social media posts share video of swiss based researcher who claims that the european medicines agency  ema  has  linked  covid    vaccines to        deaths  this is false  report of fatality

have been caused  for example  by health problems not related to the vaccination  for most medicines  the vast majority of suspected side effects are not eventually confirmed as side effects   this is echoed by description of eudravigilance that states   the information on this website relates to suspected side effects  ie medical events that have been observed following the administration of the covid    vaccines  but which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine   another illness could be the cause  or the incident could be associated with other medication taken by the

iceland  norway and liechtenstein  since january       the ema has published detailed safety data about each authorized covid    vaccine here  and although serious side effects have been reported following vaccination  they are uncommon  according to the agency   ema has identified few rare but serious side effects with covid    vaccines  and in some  but by no means all cases  these have proved fatal   the spokeswoman said   apart from these rare cases  there is no indication that the deaths reported were caused by vaccination   in an april      statement  the agency said that possible link between very rare blood clots and the astrazeneca  vaxzevria  covid    vaccine had been found  but it concluded that the benefits of the shot still outweighed the risks  the european

on july           the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  held press briefing in which the agency announced it had reversed its previous mask recommendations in response to an uptick in nationwide covid    infections and the spread of the delta variant  following the announcement  the pseudoscience conspiracy theory website natural news reported on july    that the health agency not only changed its stance of wearing masks but that it had also stated that vaccines were failing and that vaccinated individuals were considered superspreaders  natural news quoted confession it claimed cdc director dr  rochelle walensky publicly stated  describing vaccines as failing and that vaccinated people may now carry higher viral loads than unvaccinated people  in making these public statements  the cdc just admitted that the entire promise that vaccinated people were immune to covid and couldnt spread it to others just unraveled  immediately  the cdc demanded that the entire nation reverts to neanderthal mask mandates  even for those who have been fully vaccinated  similar claims were also made by radio personality stew peters on the video platform rumble  in an interview summarized on his rumble page as follows  dr  jane ruby joined stew peters to reveal that the delta variant may not be the killer  but that the vaccines are likely causing the trauma being treated at hospitals  having encountered these allegations  snopes readers sent us the following screenshots to determine whether certain claims made by the reporters were accurate   snopes listened to the    minute press briefing in its entirety and found that there was no truth to the above quoted claims made by natural news   the audio recording is available via the cdc website  we have also listed the full statement issued by cdc director dr  rochelle walensky at the bottom of this article   the cdc did not say that vaccines were failing  in fact  the agency stated that had more americans been vaccinated  there would not be surge in cases  as cdc has recommended for months  unvaccinated individuals should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated in areas with substantial and high transmission  said walensky  at no point during the press briefing did walensky say that vaccinated individuals were superspreaders  vaccinated individuals  she said  continued to represent very small amount of transmission occurring throughout the nation  we continue to estimate that the risk of breakthrough infection with symptoms upon exposure to the delta variant is reduced by sevenfold  the reduction is    fold for hospitalizations and death  she added  as such  we rate this claim false  however  it is important to note that scientific evidence suggests that vaccinated people can carry as much virus as others in what has become known as so called breakthrough infections  particularly in response to infection by the more dangerous delta variant  walensky outlined these concerns and the cdcs response to them in her introductory statement  which snopes transcribed below  as you have heard from me previously  this pandemic continues to pose serious threat to the health of all americans  i have said throughout my tenure at cdc that our guidance and recommendations will follow the science in our efforts to protect the health of as many americans as possible and today we have new science related with adults variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you are fully vaccinated  delta variant is showing everyday its willingness to outsmart us and to be an opportunist in areas where we have not shown fortified response against it  this week our data shows that delta remains the predominant variant circulating in the united states  eight out of ten sequence samples contain the delta variant  in recent days  i have seen new scientific data from recent outbreak investigations showing that the delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that causes covid     information on the delta variant from several states and other countries indicates that in rare occasions  some vaccinated people infected with delta variant after vaccination may be contagious and spread the virus to others  this new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations  first  we continue to strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated  getting vaccinated continues to prevent severe illness  hospitalization  and death even with delta  it also helps reduce the spread of the virus in our communities  vaccinated individuals continue to represent very small amount of transmission occurring around the country  we continue to estimate that the risk of breakthrough infection with symptoms upon exposure to the delta variant is reduced by sevenfold  the reduction is    fold for hospitalizations and death  as cdc has recommended for months  unvaccinated individuals should get vaccinated and continue masking until they are fully vaccinated in areas with substantial and high transmission  cdc recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant and protect others  this includes school  cdc recommends that everyone in k through    schools wear mask indoors  including teachers  staff  students  and visitors regardless of vaccination status  children should return to full time in person learning in the fall with proper prevention strategies in place  finally  cdc recommends community leaders encourage vaccination and universal masking to prevent further outbreaks in areas of substantial and high transmission with the delta variant  vaccinating more americans now is more urgent than ever  the highest spread of cases and severe outcomes is happening in places with low vaccination rates and among unvaccinated people  this moment and  most importantly  the associated illness  suffering and death could have been avoided with higher vaccination coverage in this country  covid    continues to present many challenges and has exacted tremendous toll on our nation  we continue to follow the signs closely and update the guidance should the science shift again  we must take every step we can to stop the delta variant and end this pandemic,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

charles hoffe claims in video posted on facebook on july         that spike proteins elicited by covid    vaccines using mrna technology will cause  microscopic  and scattered blood clots that permanently damage tissue  hoffe claims the clots are too small to show up on scans  but that he has identified them using blood tests for substance called d dimer  which are used to find evidence of clots  the video    which has been watched more than         times and also appeared on facebook here  here and here  as well as on bitchute and rumble    is just one example of doctors providing inaccurate information about covid    and vaccines  health agencies in north america and europe assure that the shots are safe  though they say rare cases of blood clots have occurred in people who have received covid    vaccines based on different technology  not the mrna shots   i m still trying to accumulate more information  but on the ones i have so far     percent of them have evidence of clotting  which means that these blood clots are not rare  it means that the majority of people are getting blood clots that they have no idea that they re even having   hoffe says in the video  but experts told afp that  contrary to hoffe s claim  elevated d dimer levels alone are not proof of blood clots  d dimer test can be prescribed by specialist when blood clot is suspected  but high d dimer level in vaccinated patients would not necessarily be worrying   when you are vaccinated  there is often inflammation  you have little fever  aches and pains  it proves that the vaccine works   marie antoinette sevestre pietri  president of the french society of vascular medicine  said on july      an inflammatory reaction will result in an elevated d dimer level  but this does not mean that thrombosis will occur   dr nicolas gendron  physician in the hematology department of the georges pompidou hospital in paris  agreed   having high d dimer level doesn t mean that you have thrombosis   which is the formation of blood clot in the heart or in blood vessel  he said on july     it means that  additional examinations  such as ct scan  will be necessary to confirm it   he added  the french society of hematology said on july    that d dimer levels  increase with age  in pregnant women and in many pathological situations such as bacterial or viral infections  even benign ones    experts contacted about hoffe s claim emphasized that he did not describe the process he used to reach his conclusions  and that his results have not been peer reviewed   the experiment reported by dr hoffe is not scientific study  and does not fall under the heading of  evidence based medicine   therefore  no credit can be given to these results   the french society of hematology said  sevestre pietri agreed  saying   we don t know how he chose his sample among his patients  if he took six patients from his practice who are over    years old  they will necessarily have high d dimer level   she added that   the scientific method used is not described and the results are not published    contrary to the canadian doctor s claims  june      study found that of all the participants who received the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  which uses mrna technology like moderna s   none developed symptomatic thrombotic events during the study period  none of the parameters showed clinically relevant variations at different time points before and after vaccination   vaccines based on the viral vector technology such as astrazenecas have been linked to cases of blood clots  but these events remain rare  the technology uses modified version of different  harmless virus  to deliver instructions to cells that enable them to fight the coronavirus  use of the astrazeneca and johnson   johnson vaccines was halted in some countries following reports of rare blood clots  but it has since resumed  the canadian federal government has approved four vaccines so far  one each from pfizer biontech and moderna that use messenger ribonucleic acid  mrna  technology  and two more from astrazeneca and johnson   johnson  which are viral vector  more than    million doses of covid    vaccines in total have been administered in canada,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

a study on the effects of covid vaccines during pregnancy shows     of respondents miscarried  contrary to what its authors claimed  this claim is misleading and based on an incorrect calculation  the study it is based on found the rates of miscarriage were no different to those before covid     although it concedes that further research is needed  an article by the website daily expose  shared on facebook and instagram  claims the us centre for disease control and prevention  cdc  grossly underreported miscarriage figures found in study on covid    vaccine safety during pregnancy Â  however  this is misleading  as it ignores much of the relevant data and therefore totally contradicts the studys conclusions Â  the study examined the records of     respondents who had been given covid    vaccine and had completed pregnancy  which means the pregnancy had ended in live birth  spontaneous or induced abortion  stillbirth or ectopic pregnancy Â  it found that       of those respondents reported pregnancy loss  of which       were miscarriages  the study found these rates were within normal range  and that the preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among respondents who received mrna covid    vaccines  however  the daily expose claimed the       miscarriage figure was incorrect because the majority of respondents were vaccinated during the third trimester  when it is impossible to suffer miscarriage Â Â  the article claims the true miscarriage rate was      this was calculated by excluding all     participants who had live births who were vaccinated in their third trimester  this left     people who received the vaccine in the first two trimesters      of whom       had miscarriages Â  this argument is incredibly misleading Â  dividing the number of people who had miscarriages by the number who had completed pregnancies and were vaccinated in the first or second trimester does not give the miscarriage rate in the first and second trimester Â  gynaecologist dr jen gunter wrote in newsletter  of course when you remove those     pregnancies the miscarriage rate looks artificially high  because the only way person got into the data set was if the pregnancy had ended and they had been vaccinated  to calculate the actual miscarriage rate for those vaccinated in the first and second trimesters  youd need to divide the number of miscarriages by the total number of completed pregnancies of those who were vaccinated before    weeks  but we dont have that total yet because most of those people are still pregnant Â  as was noted in the study  the majority of participants from the v safe registry who were vaccinated in their first and second trimesters had not given birth or otherwise by the time of the studys publication  having complete data from more of this cohort would have given the study greater balance and better picture of outcomes across all pregnancies Â  the claim that its impossible to have miscarriage in the third trimester is only correct in sense  miscarriage is commonly defined as the loss of pregnancy before    weeks of gestation  just before the end of the second trimester   losing pregnancy in the third trimester is possible  but is known as stillbirth  one was recorded in the study  Â  it is worth noting the relatively high incidence of miscarriage in pregnancy across all groups  with as many as         people in the uk every year sadly losing their pregnancy  accounting for one in five pregnancies Â  while the researchers said the data did not indicate obvious safety signals they concede more longitudinal follow up  including follow up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy  is necessary  the study also looked at some benefits of vaccination  citing new evidence that shows vaccination in the third trimester leads to the transfer of covid antibodies from mother to foetus during pregnancy  suggesting vaccines can help protect newborns too  Â  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  has previously stated there is no evidence to suggest the number of miscarriages reported in the uk following vaccination falls outside the normal range for miscarriages in general Â  advice from the nhs says the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines have been widely used during pregnancy in other countries and no safety concerns have been identified  evidence reviewed by the mhra has raised no specific concerns for safety in pregnancy  we have checked multiple misleading claims about the relationship between vaccines and pregnancy  including that vaccine shedding can cause miscarriage and that the vaccines have caused     miscarriages since january,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

thirty two deaths from the swine flu vaccine in      halted the programme  full fact could not find confirmed number of deaths reported after swine flu vaccine in       but reports suggest that number of the deaths could not be directly linked with the vaccine  the rollout was halted because of number of reports of guillain barrÃ© syndrome  and the fact the swine flu cases never reached pandemic levels  more than        people have died from covid    vaccines in the us so far  false  according to the cdc there have been       reports of death among people who received covid    vaccine in the us  although this figure is much higher when including people based outside the us or in an unknown location  deaths reported after covid    vaccine are not necessarily caused by the vaccine  several posts on instagram have compared the rollout of swine flu vaccine in the us in the     s with the covid    vaccination programme Â Â  the posts claim that the rollout of the swine flu vaccine in      was halted after it caused    deaths  while more than        people have died from the covid vaccines in the us alone Â  full fact could find no official confirmation of    deaths caused by the vaccine  though this figure has been reported as one estimate  and reports state that the rollout was halted after concerns around the risk of guillain barrÃ© syndrome Â  according to the cdc  there were       reports of death among people who received covid    vaccine up to    july  but there is no evidence these were directly caused by the vaccine Â  the posts also claim that typically over    deaths will halt vaccine in the us Â  we could find no credible source confirming threshold of    deaths before vaccine roll out is paused Â  what happened with the      swine flu vaccine Â  in february       several soldiers at us army post in new jersey fell ill with an unrecognised form of swine flu  which was later found to have spread to more than     people  by march  president gerald ford had announced vaccine programme intending to immunise every man  woman and child in the us in the autumn of the same year Â  full fact could find no definitive confirmation of    deaths after vaccination  with range of estimates offered by different sources  cnn article states  the program was suspended after at least    people died from vaccine reactions  other estimates put the death toll at    people  while los angeles times article states  more than     people are thought to have developed guillain barrÃ© syndrome  gbs  after receiving the vaccine     died Â  gbs is rare condition that affects the nerves  causing problems such as numbness in the limbs  and can in some cases be life threatening  it is thought to be caused by an issue with the immune system where the body mistakenly attacks and damages the nervesespecially after an infection such as flu  or food poisoning Â  different article  available on the national center for biotechnology information  ncbi  site says that by    october          deaths amongst people who had been given the vaccine had been reported by the cdc  but there was still no known connection to  the  vaccine Â  deaths without proven link to the vaccine became the focus of intense media coverage  another article on the ncbi site points to the intense media activity surrounding the death of three elderly people who received the vaccine at the same clinic  there was no evidence the deaths were caused by the vaccine  the vaccination programme was halted in december       days after the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  reported number of cases of gbs among individuals after receiving the jab Â  at the time  consensus was reached that the number of gbs cases was in excess of what would normally be expected  but later research has since found that the chances of developing the condition after vaccination are extremely small  approximately one additional case of gbs for every         people who got the swine flu vaccine   health officials  weighing the threat of the virus against the reports of gbs  decided to halt the immunisation programme until the issue could be explored Â  in reflection on the events of       pascal james imperato  deputy health commissioner and the chair of the task force charged with rolling out the programme in new york at the time  writes  the guillain barrÃ© syndrome is known to occur after immunizations and certain incidence was expected after swine influenza immunizations Â  because of intense surveillance of vaccines for all kinds of side reactions and the litigious atmosphere surrounding the swine flu program  these cases surfaced very quickly  the swine flu identified in      did not lead to pandemic  to date  covid    has killed more than         people in the us  with more than      million infections Â  have almost        people died from the covid    vaccine in the us Â  according to the cdc  there were       reports of death among people who received covid    vaccine through the vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  up to    july  more than     million vaccines have been administered in the us Â  healthcare providers  vaccine manufacturers  and the public can submit reports to vaers  but reports are not confirmed side effects Â  the vaers site includes substantial caveat noting this  stating  while very important in monitoring vaccine safety  vaers reports alone cannot be used to determine if vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness Â  the reports may contain information that is incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental  or unverifiable  most reports to vaers are voluntary  which means they are subject to biases  one instagram post attributes the total of        deaths to site which presents vaers data and appears to include in its count thousands of reported deaths with foreign or unknown location  again  even if these were to be included in the toll  there is no evidence that these deaths were caused by vaccines  would    deaths usually stop vaccine rollout in the us Â  we could find no credible sources suggesting that there is specific threshold of    deaths in order for vaccine rollout in the us to be halted  and have contacted the cdc for more information Â  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because the swine flu threat and covid    pandemic are not comparable  and the number of deaths claimed to be caused by the vaccine cannot be confirmed  there is no evidence that    deaths specifically would normally stop vaccine

by claim  taking the vaccine enables you to light bulb without electricity  according to viral video  the covid    vaccine cannot light bulb  available evidence shows that covid    vaccines do not contain any implant or electrical ingredient to light up electrical bulbs  video which was widely circulated on social media shows man placing bulb against the spot on his arm where he claims to have received the vaccine  and the bulb comes on  the claim infers that the covid    vaccine he had taken contains ingredients that produce electricity to light bulb when placed against the vaccination spot  this has brought about doubts around the safety of the vaccines being administered in sierra leone watch the video here  according to the world health organisation  vaccines are generally made out of the following components  these components are generic and apply to all vaccines  but because there are different ways to create vaccines and each vaccine produced has specific compounds unique to its design  currently  there are two vaccines being administered in sierra leone Â  oxford astrazeneca and sinopharm Â  the oxford astrazeneca is viral vector vaccine which means it uses modified version of virus  known as the vector  to produce large amounts of antigens and trigger an immune response  the vector in this vaccine is the spike protein found on the surface ofÂ  modified adenovirus which causes the common cold in chimpanzees  one dose      ml  of theÂ  astrazeneca covid    vaccine contains  recombinant  replication deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector encoding the sars cov   spike glycoprotein  polysorbate     emulsifier   ethanol and disodium edetate dihydrate  preservatives   l histidine hydrochloride monohydrate  l histidine  amino acids   sodium chloride  magnesium chloride hexahydrate and sucrose  salts and sugars   water  diluent Â  sinopharm is whole virus vaccine which means weakened or deactivated form of the pathogen that causes covid    was used to create it  the inactivated pathogens cannot infect cells and replicate  but can trigger an immune response  one     ml dose of the sinopharm vaccine is composed of     u    g  of inactivated sars cov   antigens and aluminium hydroxide adjuvant in phosphate buffered saline  pbs       pbs is composed of disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate  sodium dihydrogen phosphate  and sodium chloride  the ingredients of these two vaccines have been published by the world health organization and other reputable health authorities and none have been found to compose electric or electronic qualities Â  the risk communication lead for sierra leones national covid    emergency response centre nacoverc  harold thomas  says nothing in the vaccine is electronic Â  the vaccine contains material from the virus that causes covid    that gives our bodies instructions to fight against the virus if we are infected Â  it increases our resistance or decreases our susceptibility to the virus  he adds  they are safe and efficacious  the first point of call to verify this claim was to find out whether there are lightbulbs which could be powered by human touch  it turns out there are many emergency bulbs  similar to the one in the viral video  that turn on when touched  an illustration with one such bulb is done in this video  in longer explanatory video  it is revealed that such bulbs have rechargeable battery in it and it powers the bulb when it comes in contact with conductor  perspiration or moisture present on the arm or fingers or any part of the body act like conductor  this possibly explains why in the viral video  the light turned on when it came in contact with water Â  similar video was found to have been done in nigeria to counter this claim  where persons in the video who had not taken the vaccine used water to power similar lightbulb  the risk communication lead for nacoverc  harold thomas says battery operated bulb can light anywhere or on anything that is wet Â  it has been confirmed that there are indeed bulbs that can be powered by human touch but these bulbs have been designed to conduct energy from body heat  so they will light up when in contact with parts of the body regardless of taking the vaccine Â  there are even some lightbulbs that have been designed to conduct energy from water  see few here  here and here evidence available shows that covid    vaccines do not contain any electronic or magnetic material  there is no scientific evidence that proves taking the vaccine enables the recipient to switch on lightbulb  therefore such claim is false,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

because you re not charged for it the claim isÂ wrong Â vaccines were found to be safe and effective before being given emergency use authorization and being made available to the public  andÂ gates

native americans should be inÂ the first group to be prioritized after health care workers  but she didÂ explain whyÂ in an interview with timeÂ magazineÂ three weeks before  gates said black people and  many other people of color  should be prioritized to get the vaccineÂ because  they are having disproportionate effects from covid      native americans and black people are about three times as likely to be hospitalized with covid    as non hispanic white people  and about twice as likely to die from the virus  according to recent dataÂ from the u s Â centers for disease control and prevention  one of the reasons race and ethnicity have an impact on how people experience illnesses is because they are tied to other conditions  such as access to health care and exposure to the virus due to occupation  the cdc wrote in its analysis  fact check  claim about unvaccinated being sent to quarantine camps started as satire the time interview also drew controversy and prompted misinformation  someÂ mischaracterized the interviewÂ to mislead about gates  remarks to the magazine  gates never said this prioritization would be to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine onÂ african americans or native americans  by the timeÂ the three covid    vaccines  pfizer biontech  moderna  and johnson and johnson  wereÂ given emergency use authorization in the u s   they had goneÂ through extensive clinical trials that tested their safety  thoseÂ trials found the vaccines were safe  as sideÂ effects were mild to moderate and consistently went away within few days Â  in terms of efficacy  the pfizer and moderna vaccines were found to be     and     effective  respectively  the johnson and johnson vaccine was around     effective at reducing moderate to severe covid     number that was lower in partÂ because covid    was much more prevalent in the u s Â when the trials for johnson   johnson were being conducted  fact check  no evidence countries  vaccine rollout  leaders  deaths connected the trials varied in size depending on the vaccine  for instance Â pfizer s trial studied nearly        participants  and johnson and johnson s trial studied more than        participants  so  theÂ assertion that the vaccines would haveÂ their safety and efficacy tested on the first people toÂ be vaccinated  claimed to beÂ african americans and native americans Â is inaccurate  based on our research  we rate false the claim that melinda gates said black people and native americans should be the first to receive the covid    vaccine  to experiment   the video

toÂ be vaccinated  thatwasn t to test the vaccine s safety  it wasÂ becauseÂ african americans and native americans wereÂ having  disproportionate effects from covid      she told time around the same

source  robert malone  war room pandemic     jul       Â      review   on    july       the podcast war room  pandemic  hosted by steve bannon  published this video interview with molecular biologist robert malone  former researcher at the salk institute  the video was widely shared on social media platforms  receiving more than        interactions on facebook  instagram  reddit  and twitter  see examples here  here  here  and here  both bannon and malone have previously spread misinformation on covid    vaccines  in november       twitter permanently suspended bannon after he suggested that certain u s  officials like anthony fauci should be beheaded  violating the platforms policies against the glorification of violence  youtube later removed the podcasts channel in january      for violating the platforms policies on misinformation  during the interview  one of the primary claims made by malone is that covid    vaccination will make sars cov   more dangerous due to mechanism called antibody dependent enhancement  ade   ade occurs when antibodies dont block virus from infecting cells  but instead improve its ability to infect cells  this phenomenon increases the risk that individuals with preexisting antibodies from previous natural infection or vaccination develop more severe disease when exposed again to the virus  claims that covid    vaccines would cause ade started circulating on social media platforms early in the pandemic  such claims are baseless and actually contradict scientific evidence  as we explain below  the first reports of ade came from patients with dengue virus infections  researchers observed that previous infection with one of the four serotypes of the virus often worsened the symptoms of the disease if the person had second infection with different serotype  this phenomenon caused problems in the development of vaccines for dengue  respiratory syncytial virus  rsv   measles  and some coronaviruses  including severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  associated coronavirus  sars cov    and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  mers cov   scientists did express concern over the potential of ade during the development of covid    vaccine candidates     however  previous knowledge helped researchers to minimize this risk from the early stages of covid    vaccine development     this influenced critical decisions during vaccine design  such as the choice to target the spike protein instead of other viral proteins that had caused ade in vaccine candidates against past coronaviruses     researchers also conducted specific animal studies to detect ade and closely monitored clinical trial participants for any sign of this phenomenon during the testing of covid    vaccine candidates     the result of this awareness is that the covid    vaccines developed so far showed no signs of ade in animal studies  clinical trials  or during vaccine rollout  real world studies further demonstrate that all fda authorized covid    vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease and death       furthermore  infections in fully vaccinated individuals are rare and tend to produce milder symptoms than in those who didnt receive the vaccine       this is exactly the opposite of what one would expect if ade was occurring  during the interview  malone further claimed that sars cov   variants are most likely developing in the people who have been vaccinated  increasing the risk of ade  as health feedback explained in previous reviews  current evidence doesnt support the claim that covid    vaccines lead to more viral variants  and actually contradicts it  each time the virus replicates  it can introduce mutations  which are changes in its genetic sequence  these changes are random and natural process in viral evolution  the more infections the virus causes  the more times it replicates  increasing the likelihood of generating new mutations that might spread as new variants  some studies suggest that long lasting infections also favor the development of new mutations  because covid    vaccines effectively prevent infections  hospitalizations  and deaths  they also make it less likely for the virus to mutate and for new variants to spread  in contrast  unvaccinated individuals are more likely to get infected and develop severe covid     increasing the chances of new variants to emerge  if covid    vaccines did lead to more variants  those regions with higher vaccination rates would observe more new variants circulating among the population  this isnt the case  in fact  all current variants of concern emerged in       before the vaccination campaigns began  given the above evidence that covid    vaccines arent worsening the disease  on what grounds claimed malone that covid    vaccines cause ade  during the interview  malone mentioned    july      article by nbc news discussing an imminent update on face mask guidance from the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   this update reversed previous indoor mask wearing policy and recommended that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors again in places with high transmission rates  according to malone  nbc news reported that this change in guidance responded to new data suggesting that people vaccinated against covid    had more virus than unvaccinated individuals  malone also shared this claim in tweet  together with screenshot from usa today article echoing that of nbc news  usa today removed this part of the article in later update  however  neither nbc news nor usa today stated what malone claimed they did  instead  what they reported  the biden administration is issuing new guidance tuesday recommending indoor mask use in areas with high transmission rates  after reviewing new data suggesting fully vaccinated individuals are not just contracting covid     but could also be carrying higher levels of virus than previously understood and potentially able to infect others  according to multiple sources close to the discussion   nbc news  nbc news  citing unnamed officials aware of the decision  reported it comes after new data suggests vaccinated individuals could have higher levels of virus and infect others amid the surge of cases driven by the delta variant of the coronavirus   usa today  multiple studies show that the few people who develop covid    after receiving the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine tend to have lower viral load than unvaccinated people       new data suggest that viral levels in vaccinated individuals who get infected with the delta variant might be as high as in unvaccinated individuals  but not higher as malone claimed      these data imply that some vaccinated individuals who get infected might still transmit the virus to others  this is what informed the cdcs decision to reverse face mask policy  as the nbc news article reported  in summary  malone misrepresented the nbc news article to claim that vaccinated individuals have higher virus levels than unvaccinated individuals  which is inaccurate  vaccinated people who become infected generally tend to have lower viral load compared to unvaccinated people  however  when infected with the delta variant in particular  viral loads in vaccinated individuals can be similar to those in unvaccinated people  but not higher  covid    vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe covid    and reducing the risk of infection  malones claim that the covid    vaccines cause ade is contradicted by the fact that vaccinated individuals who become infected tend to have milder symptoms than unvaccinated individuals  rather than the opposite  by reducing the risk of infection and severe disease  covid    vaccines also limit the spread of the virus within the population  making it less likely for new variants to emerge  the medicinal chemist derek lowe conducted detailed analysis of ade in the context of covid    vaccinesÂ in his blog on

many people believe the variants of the novel coronavirus  ncov     started appearing only after the vaccines were invented  while many claim that is due to the vaccine forcing the virus to mutate in order to survive  many others claim this is conspiracy theory by big pharma companies  we fact checked and found that these claims are false  very odd that covid barely mutated for year but once the vaccines rolled out  suddenly whole greek alphabet of variants appeared  tweeted george papadopoulos  ex aide to former president donald trump  very odd that covid barely mutated for year  but once vaccines were rolled out  suddenly whole greek alphabet of variants appeared  but the unvaccinated are somehow to blame and are most at risk  logic  folks  its life saver  number of social media users shared snapshots of the tweet on facebook supporting the view  such posts can be seen here  here  and here  no  while the world has become more knowledgeable about the minor aspects of the novel coronavirus due to continuous research  media coverage  and raising public awareness  the coronavirus had started mutating much before the vaccines were invented  the news about coronavirus starting to mutate started appearing on media by july        in june       china approved the cansino vaccine for limited use in the military  in august       russia announced the approval of its sputnik v vaccine for emergency use  but both these vaccines had limited availability  the actual launch of the vaccine can be dated to december      when the us fda granted emergency use authorization to pfizerbiontech and the moderna vaccine  by december       scientists had discovered multiple variants in many parts of the world including the spanish variant  south african variant  brazilian variant  etc  in fact  by the  rd week of december       world health organization  who  had named the alpha and beta variant  reuters graphics representation that tracks the evolution of coronavirus across      will show that at least   strands were known to scientists before the launch of the pfizerbiontech vaccine  the cdc also in briefing in january      listed down all variants that were discovered in       so  it is wrong to say that the covid virus barely mutated for year and the new variants appeared only after the vaccines are invented  scientists believe the mutations in the virus is quite normal  when cells replicate  the dna sequence in them sometimes undergoes changes  these are majorly copying errors  in humans  cells have mechanisms to proofread the genome and also mechanisms to repair sequence if an error is detected  viruses lack that and hence they mutate faster  virus with one or several new mutations is referred to as variant of the original virus Â  not always  many times  the copying error can make the virus weaker  but sometimes  the error proves to be beneficial for the virus by making it stronger and more capable to bind with the host  if mutation provides survival advantage  then that mutated version becomes the dominant strain  most of the time  scientists focus more on studying the dominant strain  and common people are also made aware of it but that does not mean that the virus only mutates to stronger strain  disclaimer  medical science is an ever evolving field  we strive to keep this page updated  in case you notice any discrepancy in the

small in the universe of millions of vaccinated people  the food   drug administration  fda  has produced new guidelines telling patients and doctors what to look for and how to treat it  but is still investigating the strength of the link  vaccine maker pfizer said the reported number would make it  rare  and that no problem was documented in pre release clinical trials  the claim appeared in

 saying   the warning in the fact sheets for healthcare providers administering vaccines notes that reports of adverse events suggest increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis  particularly following the second dose and with onset of symptoms within few days after vaccination   in june        dr  matthew oster  pediatric cardiologist on the cdc s covid    vaccine task force  produced report describing how the vaccine adverse event reporting system worked as designed  alerting the cdc and fda to minor cluster of the heart inflammation conditions  myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle  pericarditis is inflammation of the lining around the heart  myopericarditis is both conditions at once  viral infections are the most common cause  although parasites  fungi  drug sensitivities and other causes are also documented  even before the pandemic  the conditions were more common among teen men than women of all ages  review of verified cases suggests they are more common among vaccinated young men than other demographics  as seen in the following slide from oster s report  pre covid studies showed it mostly affects teen males and strikes about   out of every

sheets for recipients and caregivers for these vaccines note that vaccine recipients should seek medical attention right away if they have chest pain  shortness of breath  or feelings of having fast beating  fluttering  or pounding heart after vaccination  the fda and cdc are monitoring the reports  collecting more information  and will follow up to assess longer term outcomes over several months  fda commissioner dr  janet woodcock summed it up in the agency s standard risk versus benefit language  tweeting that people should still get the shot  since the risks of serious illness from covid    outstrip the risk of having one of the rare  and rarely fatal  cases of heart inflammation  as part of our commitment to vigilant safety monitoring of  covid   vaccines  fda updated the public on its

vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers   and the cdc s report on how it sifted and verified reports in this example of how the material in vaers should be used  in the age group with the highest prevalence  cdc reports about    million have been vaccinated  in this case  the cdc notes myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination are rare  as of july                 reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages    and younger who received covid    vaccine were reported to vaers  the cdc and fda  who jointly operate vaers  reviewed medical records and confirmed     of those       reports  any rate declared from the raw vaers data would have been almost double the actual number of suspect cases  and the question of direct causal link to the vaccines is still being investigated  as noted in several prior fact checks by lead stories  the vaers system accepts reports from anyone with an internet connection  its purpose is to serve as an early warning system  not precise measurement of adverse effects  vaers  operators repeatedly caution people reading the data not to use it to declare cause and effect connections between vaccines and health conditions  nor to declare the rate at which adverse reactions occur  lead stories reached out to pfizer  maker of the vaccine most linked to the effect  kit longley  science media relations senior manager for pfizer wrote in july           email that the drugmaker saw no evidence of the problem in its phase   clinical trial  as reported on in peer reviewed pre release study  the spokesperson for pfizer wrote  pfizer is aware of rare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis  predominantly in male adolescents and young adults  after mrna covid    vaccination  according to the cdc  this is an extremely rare side effect  and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination  patients have typically rapidly improved with conservative treatment  it is important to note that cdc continues to strongly encourage covid    vaccinations for eligible individuals aged    and older  with hundreds of millions of doses of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine administered globally  the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive  the material the fda relied on to sign off on emergency use approval showed no evidence of heart inflammations caused by the

the three minute clip has been shared more than     times since it was posted on facebook on july           besides including the claim that mrna covid    vaccines contain aborted human foetal matter  the video makes two other unsubstantiated claims  that the vaccines can alter persons dna and that they can render people sterile  the clip  which was extracted from longer video originally posted here on youtube on february          features preacher joshua maponga interviewing guest mike southwood in show dubbed why africans should not take vaccine  sic   the zimbabwe born maponga lives in south africa and is an author of several books and has large following on social media  he also runs galaxy universal network  media production company in south africa  southwood  who makes the false

administrator of the  endthelockdownmzanzi group  which has been urging south africans to defy covid    lockdown laws   shorter version of the clip was published here on facebook in south africa on july           and shared more than     times  pfizer biontech and moderna covid    vaccines are made from messenger rna  the two vaccines work by giving blueprint of part of the virus that the body can then recognise and fight when confronted by it later  the vaccines use tiny fat bubbles called lipid nanoparticles to encapsulate fragile mrna molecules and the information they contain to protect them until they can be safely delivered into cells without being degraded by the bodys enzymes   however  the claim made in the clip that the vaccines include aborted foetus cells is false   professor penny moore  from south africas national institute for communicable diseases  nicd   told afp fact check that covid    vaccines do not contain cells from aborted foetuses or any other human material  they are produced through high tech molecular biology approaches and in cultures in rigorously controlled laboratories  said moore  the world health organization  who  told afp fact check that the new mrna vaccines  such as those developed by pfizer and moderna  are synthetic vaccines and do not use foetal cell lines in their production  according to the who  vaccines are made by growing cultures of the target virus or bacterium  viruses need to grow in cells and so vaccine viruses are often grown in eggs  such as the influenza vaccine  or in cell lines derived from mammals  including humans  the cell lines that are used to grow the viruses originate from primary culture of cells from an organ of single animal that has been propagated repeatedly in laboratory  often over many decades  afp fact check has previously debunked social media posts claiming that covid    vaccines contain mrc    which the posts claim are aborted foetal cells and other dna  the best known human cell line is mrc    or medical research council cell strain    which are cells used to grow viruses for vaccines against rubella  chickenpox and hepatitis in laboratories  mrc   was originally derived from the lung tissue of an aborted foetus in the     s but has since been grown without recourse to foetal tissue  the history of vaccines  an educational tool developed by the college of physicians of philadelphia  states that in total  only two foetuses  both obtained from abortions done by maternal choice  have given rise to the human cell strains used in vaccine development  the johnson   johnson covid    vaccine  which is not an mrna but viral vector vaccine  used human cell line developed from the retinal cells of foetus aborted in      in its early production stage  but  the who said  no foetal material is present in the final j j covid    vaccine product or any other vaccine that uses human cell lines in early production stages  spokesperson for the oxford vaccine group  an organisation that was involved in producing the astrazeneca covid    vaccine  told afp fact check that during its development  they used hek     cells  the hek     cell line was originally cultivated from foetus aborted in the netherlands in the early     s   the nicds moore added that human cell lines were used only in the early stages of the production of some vaccines  for all vaccines that use cell lines during early production stages  all cells are removed during the purification process and the final vaccine product does not contain this material  the who told afp fact check that it is not aware of any vaccines currently being developed for covid    that contain cell lines obtained from foetal tissue   the unsubstantiated claim that mrna vaccines can modify human dna has been widely rejected by scientists  afp fact check has previously debunked the claim here and here  matthew miller  an associate professor with the department of biochemistry and biomedical science at mcmaster university in canada  was quoted in previous afp fact check from march      as saying that mrna is the code for proteins  it does not alter the dna of your cells  indeed  your cells naturally make mrna from dna  barry pakes  an assistant professor at the dalla lana school of public health at the university of toronto  told afp fact check in april      that the mrna cannot be integrated into the human genome  we  humans  lack the enzymes to reverse transcribe mrna to dna  the us center for disease control and prevention  cdc  also refutes the claim that covid    vaccines can alter peoples dna  covid    vaccines do not change or interact with your dna in any way  both mrna and viral vector covidd    vaccines deliver instructions  genetic material  to our cells to start building protection against the virus that causes covid     however  the material never enters the nucleus of the cell  which is where our dna is kept  the organisation states on its website  in the video  southwood claims that covid    vaccines can cause infertility  we believe that there are lot of things in this vaccine that will render people sterile the cdc states on its website that there is currently no evidence that any vaccines  including covid    vaccines  cause fertility problems  problems trying to get pregnant   kate white  an obstetrics and gynaecology professor at boston school of medicine  told afp fact check in march      that theres no vaccine in the world that can cause infertility  dasantila golemi kotra  microbiologist at york university  told afp that vaccine induced antibodies against sars cov   spike protein are unlikely to cross react with the syncytin   or    in the body and lead to infertility  golemi kotra explained that the misinformation could be stemming from the fact that the anti spike protein antibodies and the syncytin   protein of the placenta share very short amino acid region  but this doesnt mean that the immune system would attack the syncytin protein  the immune system can recognise surface in their target protein  which rarely is confined to single short amino acid sequence  she said,[0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

founder trustee of lung care foundation  explains the importance of wearing mask in this way  dr kumar  however  also said that it is not advisable for people to wear mask when they are doing any form for physical exercise as it will reduce the oxygen level in the body   dr richa sarin  pulmonology and critical care medicine consultant at fortis hospital said   the mask that regular public uses is not air tight or sealed  it is not that the co  you are releasing through your breath is not going out  these masks prevent aerosols and virus from going in or out  but the carbon dioxide molecules are much smaller in size and can go out easily through mask   this claim is completely false  in india  the official deaths due to covid    have crossed the   lakh mark  however  data from local sources and studies have said that the actual numbers could be way higher  from somewhere between     million to   million   on the contrary  only one person has died due to anaphylaxis following vaccination  as per the aational adverse events following immunisation committee  as of    july  over    crore doses of covid    vaccines have been administered in the country   claims comparing covid    with the seasonal flu have been shared from the beginning of the pandemic   while both cause respiratory disease  there are several important differences between the two disease  how they spread and their impact  the flu is caused by an influenza virus  while covid    is caused by sars cov    which is coronavirus   while the mortality rate from covid    is yet to be determined accurately  the crude mortality rate is above   percent which is much higher than that of the flu      percent    additionally  recovering from covid    does not mean person has returned to her his normal condition  studies have shown the lingering effects of the disease on the patients in what is termed as long covid  report published in the british medical journal said that    percent of people admitted with covid    would need ongoing support  therefore  it is incorrect to equate covid    with the flu,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

while attending rally in southern california in july       attorney thomas renz claimed that an anonymous government whistleblower had proof that an estimated        people had died within three days of receiving their covid    vaccine  renz was speaking at clay clarks reawaken america tour in anaheim  california  on july     the video  archived here  and its purported claims were shared by number of far right conspiracy websites  including info wars and fear unmasked  though the claims were unfounded  many posters of the video argued that the allegations made during renzs speech provided evidence that the federal government was lying about the safety and efficacy of the covid    vaccine  im filing papers in federal court today  so you guys are the first to hear  go ahead and post it  it will be censored in about six seconds  renz told the audience  but  heres what im going to say to those who are going to censor this  google  youtube  facebook  twitter  let me tell you what im going to say  you are complicit in causing death and i cannot wait to sue you over and over again  snopes watched and transcribed the    minute video and determined that renz is an ohio attorney who has vocally taken stance against covid    mask mandates and vaccinations  he has used his platform to peddle unfounded claims that the government is lying about vaccinated individuals dying in mass numbers  the shaky video in question was recorded on july    and posted the following day to bitchute  social video hosting platform that was launched in      as an alternative to youtube  an analysis published in      by team of computer scientists found that only handful of channels receive any engagement  and almost all of those channels contain conspiracies or hate speech  look at the supreme court of ohio attorney directory revealed that renz attended case western reserve university and is actively practicing in the state for renz law  llc   of which he is the founder  at the core of his argument was lawsuit renz filed in alabama on behalf of americas frontline doctors  afd  against the u s  department of health and human services secretary  dhhs  xavier becerra that claimed the federal government did not have grounds to roll out any of the three covid    vaccinations  complaint  which starts lawsuit  was formally filed on june    demanding jury trial  renz was listed as signatory in the below statement  the vaccines are unapproved  inadequately tested  experimental and dangerous biological agents that have the potential to cause substantially greater harm than the sars cov   virus and the covid    disease itself  read the complaint  the complaint further noted that the countrys vaccine emergency use authorizations were unjustified and that there is not now  and there never has been  bona fide public health emergency due to the sars cov   virus or the covid    disease  while some have used the lawsuit to suggest there is legitimacy in its contents  it is important to note that filing lawsuit does not guarantee that the case has legal or factual merit  next  the defendant will have chance to respond and  if they choose  file motion to dismiss the case after which federal court in alabama will decide whether to move forward  the video in question came out as renz filed an injunction on july    asking that the defendant  becerra  stop the emergency use authorizations for covid    vaccines while the case is pending  this legal document also alleged that government insider and computer programmer with subject matter expertise in healthcare data analytics had evidence that proved that covid    vaccines were dangerous  i know  based on this womans testimony because she has seen the inside of the systems  that there have been        deaths based on how many people died within three days of the vaccine  said renz  the so called jane doe was said to have written sworn testimony declared under penalty of perjury claiming to have proof that        americans died within three days of receiving their covid    shot  it is my professional estimate that vaers  the vaccine adverse event reporting system  database  while extremely useful  is under reported by conservative factor of at least    on july          there were       deaths reported in vaers  i verified these numbers by collating all of the data from vaers myself  not relying on third party to report them  in tandem  i queried data from cms medical claims with regard to vaccines and patient deaths  and have assessed that the deaths occurring within   days of vaccination are higher than those reported in vaers by factor of at least    this would indicate the true number of vaccine related deaths was at least         put in perspective  the swine flu vaccine was taken off the market which only resulted in    deaths  the so called jane doe did not specify the parameters for which she established in her vaers search  nor did she clarify how the numbers were collated  the source also failed to describe her rationale behind establishing factor of at least    snopes also searched through the vaers system data using the below parameters and found that between jan    and july           there were an estimated       deaths associated with the covid    vaccine   even if jane does five fold estimate was true  the number of reported deaths would be closer to          this is not to say that there arent inherent flaws with the vaers system  as we have previously reported  the national vaccine safety monitoring system accepts reports of adverse events after vaccination but it does not establish cause and effect relationship between symptoms and vaccine  its public reporting tool  not vaccine death roster  vaers collects data on any adverse event following vaccination  be it coincidental or truly caused by vaccine  the report of an adverse event to vaers is not documentation that vaccine caused the event  noted the dhhs  but time and again  fabricated and dubious vaers reports have been at the center of fear mongering cries to stir opposition against vaccines  and while healthcare providers are required by law to report to vaers  anyone can file report  just because an adverse reaction is listed in the system does not mean that it is legitimate or has been evaluated by medical professionals   knowingly filing false vaers report is violation of federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment   despite claiming to have evidence to prove that        individuals died within three days of receiving their covid    vaccine  our investigation did not reveal legitimate source to suggest that such allegations are factual  and because our own query into the vaers system revealed       deaths following  but potentially unrelated to  covid    vaccination,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

an instagram post claims us supreme court ruling means that people who have received mrna based covid    vaccines are now patented and legally no longer human  the july    post from an australia themed account features screenshot referring to      case  which the text says included ruling that the human genome could be patented if modified by mrna vaccines  this means that everyone who has received the vaccine is now technically patented and something that is patented is proprietary and will be included in the definition of transhumans  the text in the screenshot says  similar screenshots and claims have circulated widely on social media  for example in video here  as well as on various meme libraries  blogs and forums  see here  here and here   the claim in the post can be traced as far back as an april    post on the covid blog  which frequently posts misinformation on covid    and vaccines  the post repeats frequently debunked claim that mrna covid    vaccines alter the human genome alongside incorrect information about the us supreme court case and legal interpretation dismissed as nonsensical by experts  the false claim that mrna vaccines for covid    modify either the human genome or dna has been addressed multiple times by aap factcheck  see here  here and here   as well as by other fact checking organisations  see here  here  here and here  and agencies such as the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   both the pfizer and moderna vaccines use messenger rna  mrna   molecule that puts dna instructions into action  to cause the bodys cells to make protein piece that in turn triggers an immune response and protects the recipient from the virus  the post attempts to link the vaccine technology to      us supreme court case involving the association for molecular pathology and myriad genetics  according to the ruling  myriad genetics had discovered the location of two genes which significantly increased the risks of breast and ovarian cancer when they mutated and had patented method for testing for these gene mutations  page     the court decided myriad genetics was unable to patent the isolation of the two cancer causing genes because they were naturally occurring  page     however  it said the creation of the synthetic cdna  dna synthesised from strand of mrna  involved in the testing process could be patented because it had been modified from its natural state  page       but the court did not find that the human genome could be patented if it was modified  as claimed in the post  in fact  the judgment explicitly stated that it did not deal with the patentability of dna in which the order of the naturally occurring nucleotides has been altered  page      the ruling also makes no mention of mrna vaccines or vaccines in general  university of utah law professor and adjunct professor in human genetics jorge contreras  who has written book on the myriad genetics supreme court case  told aap factcheck the claims in the instagram post are patently absurd  prof contreras said the post was correct that the supreme court ruled human dna could not be patented because it was product of nature  however  the same ruling did not determine that the human genome could be patented if it was modified  or that those who received vaccine which modified their genome could be patented  he added  just because patented substance is injected into person  that does not  under even the wildest interpretation of patent law  mean that the person somehow becomes patented  prof contreras said via email  at the most basic level  the us patent act expressly prohibits patenting human organisms  he referred to section     of the      leahy smith america invents act  which states  notwithstanding any other provision of law  no patent may issue on claim directed to or encompassing human organism  prof contreras said  even without this statute  the idea that injecting someone with patented vaccine renders that person patented makes no sense  does implanting patented artificial heart valve into person somehow make that person covered by the heart valve patent  does taking patented drug  of course not  the making of further copies of the mrna construct within the persons body is authorised as the natural and intended use of the patented item  the person  of course  would not be permitted to somehow extract the vaccine from his arm  then replicate it and begin to sell vaccine doses  but the idea that the person is patented is utter nonsense  george washington university health policy associate professor lara cartwright smith  who has written paper on the implications of the      supreme court case  told aap factcheck the claims in the post were both factually and legally incorrect  receiving an mrna vaccine does not and cannot alter ones dna  so the basis for the claim is wrong  dr cartwright smith said via email  she also said person cannot be legally patented  while the supreme court ruling said cdna could be patented  this in no way affected the legal status of the person who underwent the relevant procedure  she added  the associated press previously labelled similar claims as false  mrna based covid    vaccines do not alter the human genome  and even if they did  this would not mean the vaccinated were legally patented  the supreme court case cited in the posts did not find that the human genome could be patented if it were altered  in fact  us law bans any patents that involves the human organism  experts also say that using product such as vaccine for its intended purpose does not mean that the recipient themselves are then considered patented  false  content that has no basis in fact,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]

representative ron paul  used language implying that vaers reports are evidence that covid    vaccines caused the deaths  for instance  by using the phrases deaths from covid vaccines and covid vaccine deaths  both posts received more than        interactions on facebook  including likes  views  and comments  an article on trialsitenews used similar language  claiming that these vaers reports showed deaths associated with covid    vaccines and an unprecedented number of fatalities when compared to any other vaccination initiative over the past few decades given its only been available for just over half year  political activist and radio talk show host charlie kirk also repeated this claim on his show  adding he was just asking questions  just asking questions is rhetorical technique which allows person to ask leading questions and posit baseless or disproven hypotheses without having to provide evidence  he went even further to assert that     million people died after getting the vaccine with no evidence  and on top of this  he falsely claimed that vaccine companies cannot be sued  claim previously covered by health feedback  the social media posts and trialsitenews article propagate the common but misleading notion that vaers reports alone provide evidence of safety problems  despite the fact that the cdc website itself states  fda requires healthcare providers to report any death after covid    vaccination to vaers  even if its unclear whether the vaccine was the cause  reports of adverse events to vaers following vaccination  including deaths  do not necessarily mean that vaccine caused health problem  and vaers itself warns against using its data in this manner  while very important in monitoring vaccine safety  vaers reports alone cannot be used to determine if vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness  the reports may contain information that is incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental  or unverifiable  in large part  reports to vaers are voluntary  which means they are subject to biases  this creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically  data from vaers reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind  previous health feedback reviews covered iterations of this popular claim  see here  here  and here   in brief  the problem with this claim is that it fails to account for the background rate of an adverse event like death  this is important because firstly  people have been dying even before the covid    vaccines were available  secondly  even unvaccinated people die  indeed  on average  almost       people die in the u s  everyday from various causes  based on statista  to date  more than     million people in the u s  received at least one dose of covid    vaccine and more than     million are fully vaccinated  what deace  paul  kirk  and trialsitenews failed to show is that deaths in vaccinated people are more likely to die compared to unvaccinated people  or that deaths among vaccinated people exceed that baseline or background rate of death  this is critical first step in inferring causal relationship between the vaccine and an adverse event like death  in any event  reviews of post vaccination death reports by scientists didnt show an increase in the mortality rate of vaccinated people  as explained in an earlier health feedback review  against the backdrop of the hundreds of millions who have been vaccinated in the u s   the death reports on vaers dont point to significant safety concern  furthermore  trialsitenews comparison of reports related to covid    vaccines and other vaccines is misleading  as explained in an earlier health feedback review  this is due to covid    vaccines being under emergency use authorization  unlike approved vaccines  this difference in status means that healthcare providers are legally obliged to report any deaths occurring among people who received the covid    vaccine  even if there is no indication that the vaccine is involved in the death Â  therefore  reports of deaths post covid    vaccination would be submitted more frequently than for other vaccines to date  and it wouldnt be unusual to find more reports for covid    vaccines compared to other vaccines  the cdc did state that it received        reports of death on    july       the day that deace  paul  and others published their posts  however  at the time of this reviews writing  the cdc website stated that during this time  vaers received       reports of death           among people who received covid    vaccine  its unclear what prompted the abrupt change in numbers within few days  health feedback reached out to the cdc for clarification and will update this review if we hear back

be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people  which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts  revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks  the cdc and fda vaccine safety monitoring systems  which were expanded for the covid    vaccines and also include new smartphone based reporting tool called v safe  have subsequently identified only few  very rare adverse events Â  for more  see how safe are the vaccines  link to this an image

source  tomi lahren  facebook  twitter     jul       Â      review   on    july       political commentator tomi lahren published this tweet claiming that vaccinated people can get covid    and have over     chance of survival  just like unvaccinated people  suggesting that covid    vaccines arent useful  she later shared the post on facebook  receiving more than         interactions on the platform in one day  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  claims that covid    vaccines arent useful because they dont prevent      of infections or because the disease has high survival rate arent new  see examples here  here  here  and here   in her post  lahren further suggested that people have the same chance of surviving covid    regardless of whether they are vaccinated or not  these claims are inaccurate and misleading in several ways  as we will discuss below  it is false that unvaccinated individuals have the same chance of surviving covid    as vaccinated people  unvaccinated people are much more likely to become infected and get sick  in fact  unvaccinated people account for virtually all recent covid    hospitalizations and deaths in the u s  this was the clear message of the director of the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   rochelle walensky  in    july      white house briefing  this is becoming pandemic of the unvaccinated  we are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk  and communities that are fully vaccinated are generally faring well  besides the personal risk of infection  lower vaccination rates facilitate the transmission of the virus within the population  increasing the risk of outbreaks  indeed  infections  hospitalizations  and deaths are primarily rising in those u s  states with lower vaccination rates  such as mississippi or alabama  these two states  which have fully vaccinated     of their population  reported    and    covid    deaths respectively and almost       cases together during the last seven days  based on the   april      u s  population census  these numbers represent rate of   and   deaths per million population respectively  and     cases per         inhabitants in both states together  in contrast  the states of massachusetts and connecticut that have fully vaccinated more than     of their populations reported    and   deaths respectively and only       cases together during the same time  these figures represent rate of     and      deaths per million population respectively  and    cases per         inhabitants  in alabama              of the     covid    deaths from the past three months occurred among unvaccinated people  and only           were in fully vaccinated people  lahrens post implied that vaccines are useless because small proportion of vaccinated people can still get infected  this misleading argument is also known as the nirvana fallacy  lahren dismissed solution because it is imperfect  even though perfect solution is impossible  no vaccine is      effective  and covid    vaccines arent an exception  however  this doesnt mean we should reject them  just as we wouldnt reject parachute before jumping from an airplane just because they dont open in      of the cases  although not perfect  the three covid    vaccines authorized by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  are highly effective against severe disease  real world studies in israel  the u k   and the u s  showed that mrna covid    vaccines are over     effective in preventing hospitalization and death  and about     effective against infection in real life conditions       furthermore  covid    infections in fully vaccinated individuals are rare and tend to produce milder symptoms than in unvaccinated individuals       lahren claimed that covid    has survival rate of over      this claim is misleading because the likelihood of dying of covid    varies greatly between individuals  depending on factors such as age or underlying health conditions  as health feedback explained in this review  this table from the cdc shows how the risk of covid    hospitalization and death increases with age  adults aged between    and    years old are already four times more likely to die than people aged    to    years old  the likelihood of dying increases up to     times for those aged    and older  although children and young adults are less likely to die of covid    compared to older age groups  there is no group that experiences the absence of risk  in the u s   provisional death counts from the cdc as of    july      show that people aged   to    years old accounted for     covid    deaths  while       deaths occurred among people between    to    years old  in addition  certain medical conditions  such as heart and respiratory conditions  weakened immune system  cancer  diabetes  or obesity can increase persons likelihood of dying from covid     regardless of their age  pregnant people are also more likely to get severely ill from covid    compared with non pregnant people  the proportion of infected people who end up dying of covid    is difficult to estimate and can vary depending on the characteristics of the population  such as age  sex  and percentage of people with underlying health conditions  even within the same population  this proportion can change over time depending on the circumstances at that specific point in time  while the development of vaccines and effective treatments can help decrease mortality  an overloaded healthcare system due to surge in the number of infections might lead to higher death rates  small differences between the survival rates of vaccinated and unvaccinated people might seem negligible but they still account for high number of deaths  for instance  difference of just      in the likelihood of death means that one more person will die for every       who become infected  only in the past week  the u s  reported more than         new covid    cases  in this case  an increase of      in covid    mortality would represent     more deaths in just one week  in her post  lahren presented covid    outcomes as dichotomy between death and survival  however  the evidence shows that such reductive view is inaccurate and misleading  lahrens post ignored the fact that many covid    survivors continue to suffer from health problems even months after recovery  in some cases  these problems are consequence of long hospitalization stays after severe illness  however  about one third of people who recover from covid    show persistent health problems even after mild disease       this condition is known as long covid  symptoms include difficulty breathing  fatigue  cognitive problems  or joint and muscle pain  these symptoms can last at least for one year after recovering from infection       growing evidence indicates that long covid causes considerable loss in quality of life and is serious health concern  an international survey published in july      in the scientific journal the lancet found that     of the       recovered covid    patients involved in the study reported to be unable to work seven months later  and     of them required reduced work schedule     in this context  covid    vaccines are an essential tool that can help prevent infections and thereby minimize peoples risk of developing long covid  many governments are anticipating the potential impact of this disabling condition by developing rehabilitation programs and promoting research on the subject  for example  the u s  national institutes for health  nih  announced in march      that it would invest   billion dollars in investigating this condition  in the u k   the national institute for health research  nihr  will fund    new studies with more than    million dollars to understand the causes and find potential treatments for long covid  lahrens claim suggested that unvaccinated individuals have similar chances of surviving covid    as those who are fully vaccinated  which makes vaccines seem useless  this is inaccurate and misleading  unvaccinated people are much more likely to become infected and get severe disease or die  furthermore  low vaccination rates favor the spread of the virus  posing health risk for all the individuals within the community  including those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons  covid    vaccines are highly effective in preventing hospitalization and death and also reduce the risk of infection  they reduce the spread of the virus within the population and prevent further health problems associated with covid    infections  such as long covid    coronavirus

a peer reviewed study that spread on social media claims covid    shots are dangerous and governments should rethink their vaccination campaigns  but the scientific paper used flawed methodology and has been retracted by the journal   paper titled  the safety of covid    vaccinations    we should rethink the policy  was initially published on june          in the scientific journal vaccines  it can be read on mdpi  an online publishing platform for unrestricted access to peer reviewed journals   figures including robert malone  physician who has been vocal in the media about the potential dangers of the covid    vaccination  and toronto lawyer rocco galati  known for representing health freedom groups in lawsuits  were among those spreading the paper on social media  malone  who conducted research on the messenger ribonucleic acid  mrna  technology    years ago  said the study concluded that for every three deaths prevented by covid    shots  the jabs had caused two deaths  posts highlighting the study appeared on facebook here and here  instagram here  and twitter here  but it was retracted  and malone s tweet is no longer available   in its retraction note  the journal said   the article was evaluated by the editor in chief with the support of several editorial board members  they found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings   the authors of the study had used metric called the  number needed to vaccinate  or nntv  based on an israeli database  they then compared the nntv with the number of adverse events reported after vaccination  filed to the dutch national safety reporting database    database similar to the vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  in the united states    currently  our estimates show that we have to accept four fatal and    serious side effects per         vaccinations in order to save the lives of     individuals per         vaccinations  placing risks and benefits on the same order of magnitude   the study concluded  it said that the  lack of clear benefit  from the covid    shot should push governments to rethink their vaccination policies   the journal says the study used the dutch data inaccurately  eugene van puijenbroek  head of science and research at the netherlands pharmacovigilance centre lareb  lareb     the dutch database used in the paper    agreed  saying   the data as mentioned on our website were interpreted incorrectly and therefore led to erroneous conclusions    the obvious incorrect and misleading use of our data was the reason for us to contact the editorial office of vaccines to ask for withdrawal of the article   he told afp   lareb is responsible for maintaining the national database for the reporting of adverse drug reactions in the netherlands  including adverse events potentially linked to the covid    vaccines  but in its reports  the dutch database does not draw direct connection between the deaths post vaccination and the vaccination itself  van puijenbroek said   in fact  our analyses showed that in cases in which fatality has been reported  existing health problems turned out to be the most obvious explanation for the fatal outcomes in the majority of cases   he said   we explicitly ask reporters  either healthcare professionals or the general public to report suspicions of adverse events   but causal relation between particular health incident and the reported drug or vaccine is not needed for report to be filed  van puijenbroek added   as of july     at least two members of the board of vaccines have resigned following the publication of the paper   katie ewer  an associate professor and senior immunologist at the jenner institute at the university of oxford  resigned on june      i had no role in the publication  of the paper  she told afp  but after reading about the study on social media  ewer decided to look into how it had been peer reviewed  she said that neither the academic editor nor the only reviewer who was not anonymous were vaccine specialists  and also highlighted major problems with the study and its methodology   it should have been recognized that this paper would have big impact  given the conclusions that it  incorrectly  draws   ewer said   that no one at the journal picked up on that and realized that the data were going to be subjected to intense scrutiny and attention is very worrying  especially for journal dedicated to vaccines  and that s why i felt resignation was my only option    florian krammer  professor at the department of microbiology at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai  also resigned from vaccines  board after the publication of the paper in the journal    i was made aware of the paper yesterday

has specific mutations that make it genetically distinct from other variants and from the precursor  wild type  virus  some of these variants may be more contagious     cause disease with more severe illness     or reduce the effectiveness of covid    vaccines     one of these variants  first detected in india in december       is the delta variant or b          the delta variant has certain

of the deceased were    years or older and    deaths occurred in those under    years old  on the same day  website that appears to be associated with an organization located in the bahamas  called we

effective against the delta variant or they might even increase the risk of death  this claim went viral on social media platforms  including facebook and instagram  see examples here  here or here   this review discusses the current figures on deaths caused by the delta variant in the u k   and how the vaccination campaign has prevented deaths due to the disease  clinical trials in the u k  israel  and canada have shown that the covid    vaccines offer high levels of protection against the delta variant for fully vaccinated people  data from the u k  phe showed an effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations of     for the pfizer biontech vaccine and     for the oxford astrazeneca vaccine  however  single dose of the pfizer biontech or the oxford astrazeneca vaccines is less protective against the delta variant  as noted in report published by public health england  phe   after single dose there was an     absolute reduction in vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with delta compared to alpha  and smaller     reduction in effectiveness after two doses  this represents an efficacy of     in the reduction of symptomatic cases due to the delta variant after receiving the first vaccine dose  some of the covid    vaccines  including the pfizer biontech and the oxford astrazeneca vaccines  require two doses to achieve full protection against the disease  for this reason  persons who have not received the second dose of the vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated  according to data from the u k   of the     deaths caused by the delta variant     people hadnt been vaccinated           had received one dose of vaccine       and     had received two doses        therefore  the majority of deaths       were among persons who hadnt acquired the full protection that is only provided two weeks after completing both doses of the vaccine  as shown in figure    while less than     of people aged    and above remained either unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated  they accounted for     of the deaths caused by the delta variant  on the other hand  while     of people aged    and above were fully vaccinated  they only accounted for     of the deaths  this demonstrates that in people aged    and above  unvaccinated people or people who arent fully vaccinated are more likely to die from the delta variant compared to fully vaccinated people of the same age group  as seen in figure     figure    the proportion of infections and deaths resulting from delta variant infection occurring in people aged    and above  classified based on vaccination status  blue  fully vaccinated  red  unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated   data obtained from public health england  its important to keep in mind that no vaccine is      effective and the covid    vaccines are no exception  this means that there will still be small proportion of vaccinated people who develop the disease and among them  some will die  as the proportion of vaccinated persons in the population increases  so does the proportion of cases in the vaccinated population  as well as the proportion of deaths in vaccinated persons  in      vaccinated population  all deaths would occur in vaccinated persons  however  vaccination would reduce the proportion of deathsa population that isnt fully vaccinated would see more deaths compared to fully vaccinated population  muge cevik  clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the university of st  andrews  explained the same concept in reuters fact check dealing with similar claim  when most people are vaccinated  most infections and deaths are expected to be among those vaccinated  furthermore  the vaccines dont increase the risk of dying from the delta variant  but actually reduce covid    deaths  according to estimates from public health england  the vaccination campaign in the u k  prevented between     and     million cases of covid    and between        and        deaths until   july       as well as preventing around        hospitalizations  the source of the information on delta variant deaths provided in the video is briefing published by phe on   july       according to the briefing  the u k  detected         cases of covid    caused by the delta variant between   february and    june      among them          were in people under    years old  around     of all cases were in this age group  and        were in people aged    or older  around     of all cases   as indicated in the video     deaths occurred in people under    years old  while     deaths occurred in people aged    and above  these figures translate to mortality rate of       in the population under    years old  and       in the population aged    or older  this shows that the delta variant has much higher fatality rate in the population aged    or older  this is in line with the evidence showing that older people are more likely to die from covid     regarding the vaccination status of the infected persons  also indicated in the phe briefing  of the         infections in persons under    years old               hadnt received the vaccine  while            had received both doses  the remaining infections       corresponded to persons who had received one dose or whose vaccination status was unknown  the situation in persons    years of age and older is different  since of the        cases of the delta variant              had received both doses                had received one dose              hadnt received the vaccine and             had an unknown vaccination status  these data show that the proportion of infected persons who had completed the vaccination schedule was higher in the population aged    or older       compared to the proportion of infected persons who had completed the vaccination schedule in the population under    years old       the u k  initiated its covid    vaccination campaign in december       focusing on different priority groups based on age and the presence of long term clinical conditions  according to report on the status of the vaccination campaign  published by phe on   july       almost     of the population aged    or older has received the second dose of the vaccine  and this figure increases to over     for the population aged    or older  on the other hand  the proportion of fully vaccinated persons in the age groups younger than    years old is notably lower  see figure     as the risk of dying from covid    correlates with age  the elderly were prioritized for vaccination  in the u k       of the individuals    or older are already fully vaccinated  therefore  vaccinated people are over represented among covid    deaths   figure    age sex pyramid for covid    vaccine

claim that people are more likely to die from the delta variant if they have been vaccinated is false  as it ignores the fact that deaths from covid    occur mainly in high risk groups  which have higher vaccine coverage than the general population  no vaccine offers perfect protection  meaning that some cases and deaths would still occur in the vaccinated population  but covid    vaccines are highly effective at reducing both the risk of hospitalization and the risk of death from covid     and have prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the u k  alone  demonstrating that vaccination has greatly improved our situation in contrast to time when no covid    vaccine was available    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0.]

people died as result of the covid    vaccine  thats how many people reportedly died shortly after vaccination up to   june  not necessarily because of the vaccine  because so many people are being vaccinated  we would expect some of them to die afterwards  by chance  there were         adverse reactions as result of the covid    vaccines and its now closer to million  these are reported reactions as of   june  we dont know that they happened because of the vaccine  just that they happened shortly afterwards  pcr tests are contaminated with dangerous gas called ethylene oxide  swabs are sterilised with ethylene oxide  which can be unsafe in large quantities  but not in the amounts used in this way  the spike protein in some covid    vaccines is toxic to humans  theres some evidence that the spike protein generated by vaccines may travel from the injection site  but we dont have evidence that its harmful  some reports suggest covid    vaccines have caused        increase in miscarriages  theres no evidence miscarriages are being caused by the vaccine  you would expect the number of miscarriages following vaccination to increase as more younger people of childbearing age  proportion of whom may have miscarriage  become eligible to get vaccinated  the vaccines contain polysorbate    and that is known to cause fertility issues  the astrazeneca vaccine does contain small amounts of this additive  which is also used in food  there is no evidence that it causes fertility issues in humans at the levels used in food and vaccines  many of our readers have asked us to check claims in video on facebook of man filming himself in police station making complaint about covid    vaccines  the video is over    minutes long  but we have looked at the main claims he makes in it here  which are about covid    vaccines and tests  amongst other things  in the video  the man claims that       people have died as result of the vaccine  that is how many people had reportedly died shortly after vaccination  up to   june  not necessarily because of the vaccine  the medicine and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  says that the majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness  as the latest version of the mhra document explains  the nature of yellow card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects  some events may have happened anyway  regardless of vaccination Â Â  on deaths  it says usage of the vaccines has increased rapidly and as such  so has reporting of fatal events with temporal association with vaccination however  this does not indicate link between vaccination and the fatalities reported  its also true  as the man says  that there were just over         suspected reactions reported up to   june  in the same way  these reactions werent necessarily caused by the vaccine  the video also claims that pcr tests contain ethylene oxide  dangerous gas  as we have written before  ethylene oxide exposure can be unsafe  but it is commonly used to sterilise medical equipment  including covid    tests  and doesnt pose any threat in this way  the mhra recently answered freedom of information request on this  explaining that the amount of residual ethylene oxide on swabs means that lateral flow test kits are safe to use  it also said  in the highly unlikely event that swab does contain residual amount above the allowable limit  the risk to the user is still considered to be very low  the man in the video reads out some quotations  which he attributes to the canadian researcher dr byram bridle  claiming that the covid vaccines produce spike protein that is toxic to humans  this is not true  we have written in detail about this before  so have many other fact checkers Â  there is protein on the surface of the virus that causes covid     called spike protein  the covid    vaccines work by giving the body instructions on how to make that spike protein  so that if the body encounters it later  the immune system can generate response that attacks the virus faster and more effectively  there is some evidence that the spike proteins generated by the moderna vaccine can leave the site of the injection  and the spike proteins on the actual virus itself have been found in the brains of people who died of covid     but this doesnt mean that the spike proteins generated by the body from the vaccine are harmful  quoting another doctor talking about the covid vaccines  the man in the video says  there are some reports to suggest there is        increase in miscarriages  this claim is misleading  and weve checked similar one before Â  miscarriages have been reported following covid    vaccinations but theres no evidence to show that vaccines were the cause  the number reported doesnt appear to exceed the level you would ordinarily expect  as weve said  the mhra yellow card scheme collects reports of adverse events following vaccination  but does not prove that vaccination was the cause of any of them  it isnt necessarily surprising that the number of miscarriages reported after vaccination has increased alongside the number of women of childbearing age being vaccinated  just by increasing that pool of people  you would expect to see larger number of pregnancies in that group  and therefore proportion of miscarriages  appearing to quote the same doctor  the man also says  it is also documented that polysorbate    is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues in relation to fertility  the astrazeneca and janssen vaccines do contain small amounts of polysorbate     which is also in certain flu jabs and is used as food additive in things like ice cream  some people may be allergic to it  but its persistent myth that polysorbate    is linked to fertility issues  study linking the chemical to reduced fertility in rats is sometimes cited as evidence  but the relative dose given to rats in the trial was significantly larger than humans would ever get in vaccine  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about

exposed  magnetism intentionally added to  vaccine  to force mrna through entire body   says the title of june         clip on rumble of jane ruby appearing on  the stew peters show   where she was introduced as medical expert  Â  Â  the video    which has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on rumble and bitchute    is part of deluge of inaccurate claims about vaccines that have spread across the internet as countries around the world seek to immunize their populations against covid      they are using magnetic fields through different chemicals to actually concentrate the rna  the mrna into people s cells   ruby claims in the video  which has also been shared thousands of times on facebook  according to the social media monitoring tool crowdtangle   we just know what and how is behind these magnetic phenomena where people are having these items sticking to them   she says  ruby    who is self described  health economist and new right political pundit     is referring to social media videos in which people claim that the covid    vaccine made them magnetic  and attempt to prove it by sticking items to various parts of their bodies   afp fact check has debunked videos making this false claim here  ruby says   where they re putting this magnetic field technology is in and around the lipid nanoparticle envelope to get this mrna into your cells  in process called  magnetofection   messenger rna molecules in pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines    the first to be authorized and distributed globally that use the cutting edge messenger ribonucleic acid technology    are fragile and manufacturers use lipid nanoparticles to protect them while they are being delivered into cells  this video explains how the shots work  magnetofection is method of transfection  or the process of artificially introducing nucleic acids  dna or rna  into cells  utilizing means other than viral infection  but it is not employed in the covid    vaccines  dasantila golemi kotra  associate professor at york university  explained on july   that  magnetofection requires the use of magnet to force molecule  on its own or bound to nanoparticles  with magnetic properties to enter cell  the molecule enters the cell as result of being drawn to the magnet positioned next to the cells    nanoparticles with magnetic properties are not used in the mrna vaccines  and no magnet is used during the injection to get the rna vaccine in our cells   she added  instead   mrna vaccines employ the use of lipids to carry the mrna inside the cells   omar khan  assistant professor at the university of toronto  agreed  he said on july    that the claims made in the video about supramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and the use of magnetic fields to achieve magnetofection do not apply to covid    vaccines   none of these components are used with the moderna and biontech mrna vaccines  there are no supramagnetic iron oxides in the mrna vaccines  no magnetic fields applied to patients and thus no magnetofection   he added that  there are thousands of different nanoparticles technologies being studied across the world  these technologies are not interchangeable   according to fact sheets provided by health authorities in the us and canada  none of the available covid    vaccinations  pfizer  moderna  johnson   johnson or astrazeneca  do not list any metal based ingredients that would be necessary for magnetofection  the us centers for disease control and prevention has also debunked the idea that the shots contain magnetic substances  saying   covid    vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection    all covid    vaccines are free from metals such as iron  nickel  cobalt  lithium  and rare earth alloys  as well as any manufactured products such as microelectronics  electrodes  carbon nanotubes  and nanowire semiconductors   the federal health agency said   in addition  the typical dose for covid    vaccine is less than milliliter  which is not enough to allow magnets to be attracted to your vaccination site even if the vaccine was filled with magnetic metal   it added  asked about the claim that vaccines contained magnetic components for previous fact check  dr thomas hope  vaccine researcher and professor of cell and developmental biology at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine said it is  impossible    there s nothing there that magnet can interact with  it s protein and lipids  salts  water and chemicals that maintain the ph  that s basically it  so this is not possible   said hope  at the      minute mark of the video  ruby shows screenshot of website belonging to german company chemicell and then cites disclaimer on the site that says   the magnetofection reagents and all of its components are developed  designed  intended and sold for research use only  they are not to be used for human diagnostic or any drug intended   contacted by afp on june     chemicell said it had  no idea  why its website was cited  it confirmed that it manufactures  magnetic particles for research use applications  laboratory use    but said its work is unrelated to the mrna covid    vaccines    magnetofection has been studied experimentally by researchers working with cell cultures  to our knowledge  magnetofection has never been tested on humans  no pharma company ever used or marketed vaccines based on magnetofection   the company said  it added that its website had been  abused  in the video to make  unfounded  claims and to fuel  irrational

researcher dr byram bridle  claiming that the covid vaccines produce spike protein that is toxic to humans  this is not true  we have written in detail about this before  so have many other fact checkers Â  there is protein on the surface of the virus that causes covid     called spike protein  the covid    vaccines work by giving the body instructions on how to make that spike protein  so that if the body encounters it later  the immune system can generate response that attacks the virus faster and more effectively  there is some evidence that the spike proteins generated by the moderna vaccine can leave the site of the injection  and the spike proteins on the actual virus itself have been found in the brains of people who died of covid     but this doesnt mean that the spike proteins generated by the body from the vaccine are harmful  quoting another doctor talking about the covid vaccines  the man in the video says  there are some reports to suggest there is        increase in miscarriages  this claim is misleading  and weve checked similar one before Â  miscarriages have been reported following covid    vaccinations but theres no evidence to show that vaccines were the cause  the number reported doesnt appear to exceed the level you would ordinarily expect  as weve said  the mhra yellow card scheme collects reports of adverse events following vaccination  but does not prove that vaccination was the cause of any of them  it isnt necessarily surprising that the number of miscarriages reported after vaccination has increased alongside the number of women of childbearing age being vaccinated  just by increasing that pool of people  you would expect to see larger number of pregnancies in that group  and therefore proportion of miscarriages  appearing to quote the same doctor  the man also says  it is also documented that polysorbate    is contained within the vaccines and this is known to cause issues in relation to fertility  the astrazeneca and janssen vaccines do contain small amounts of polysorbate,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
source  candace owens  facebook  twitter    jul       Â      review   in june       u s  district judge lynn hughes dismissed lawsuit brought by     employees of the houston methodist hospital system who claimed the hospitals covid    vaccine requirement violated the nuremberg code  the employees also compared the threat of termination unless they take the covid    vaccines to forced medical experimentation conducted by the nazi doctors  comparison judge hughes called reprehensible  though one of the more high profile examples of individuals calling vaccine requirements nuremberg code violation  the     employees arent the only ones to incorrectly make this claim  similar claims involving the nuremberg code and covid    vaccines have circulated and been fact checked before  as shown here  here and here  these claims have also been fact checked in other languages  including spanish and french  on   july       talk show host candace owens posted tweet  which she then shared on facebook  saying that the nuremberg codes  sic  stipulate that consent must be voluntary  and due to covid    vaccine requirements to attend school  work and travel  voluntary consent is not given  as such  owens claimed that the nuremberg code was being violated in such cases  she also called the covid    vaccines experimental  as well show below  the covid    vaccines dont violate the nuremberg code  which is related to medical experimentation on human subjects  not the use of authorized vaccines  the nuremberg code is list of    principles guiding research ethics for experiments involving human subjects  the code was created in      in nuremberg  germany  during the doctors trial  at which nazi doctors  accused of conducting horrifying human experiments on concentration camp prisoners  were judged     of the    physicians and scientists in the trial     were found guilty  the first of the    principles states that the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential     the other nine principles concern other aspects of the research experiments  such as how they must yield fruitful results for the good of society  and must be conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and only by scientifically qualified persons  you can read the complete nuremberg code here     one example of research study that violated the nuremberg code was the tuskegee syphilis study  conducted by the u s  public health service between      and       in order to observe the natural history of untreated syphilis in black men  researchers recruited     african american men in alabama  two thirds of which had syphilis  despite penicillin based treatment becoming available by the mid     s  the researchers didnt provide such treatment to the participants  instead  they provided ineffective medicines  like ointments  so that the recruited subjects would believe that they were receiving treatment  by the time the study ended  after front page report in the new york times      participants had died of syphilis  there are two arguments put forth by individuals who claim the covid    vaccines violate the nuremberg code  the first is that the vaccines are experimental  and therefore individuals receiving them are human subjects in an experiment  this isnt true because the covid    vaccines arent experimental  as weve shown in previous health feedback claim review  the covid    vaccines went through clinical trials and were authorized for emergency use following careful review of their benefits and potential risks  speaking to full fact  u k  fact checking organization  aston university medical sociology and medical ethics researcher alexis paton said the nuremberg code is very specifically about experimentation  participants in the covid    vaccine phase iii randomized clinical trials  for instance  read informed consent documents that provided information about the trials to ensure their voluntary participation     as such  while the    principles outlined in the nuremberg code apply to vaccine clinical trials  once vaccine is authorized or approved  the code is no longer relevant  the second argument is that vaccine requirements  such as to enroll child in public school  which is already in place  with all    u s  states requiring specific vaccines from students  or to work at hospital  violate the nuremberg code because they are form of coercion  this was one of the arguments put forth by the     employees of the houston methodist hospital system who refused the covid    vaccine  however  as judge hughes explained in his ruling  this is not coercion  methodist is trying to do their business of saving lives without giving them the covid    virus  it is choice made to keep staff  patients  and their families safer  bridges can freely choose to accept or refuse covid    vaccine  however  if she refuses  she will simply need to work somewhere else  private businesses like the houston methodist hospital system can require vaccine  and vaccine requirements are not new for hospitals  for instance  in             of surveyed u s  hospitals had influenza vaccination mandates for healthcare personnel     furthermore  u s  federal equal employment opportunity laws do not prevent an employer from requiring all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated for covid     with reasonable accommodations made for employees who cannot receive the vaccine  such medical exemptions are part of vaccine requirements  all    u s  states allow medical exemptions to students enrolling in public schools  and another    allow religious exemptions  in terms of federal mandate  though u s  states have the legal authority to institute mandatory vaccinations  there are currently no plans to do so  on   december       then president elect joe biden said covid    vaccines wouldnt be mandatory  additionally  on    may       the u s  department of homeland security said that there will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain single vaccination credential  in short  both arguments put forth by owens and others as to why covid    vaccines violate the nuremberg code are inaccurate  the first because the nuremberg code is concerned about experimental research and covid    vaccines arent experimental  the second because covid    vaccination in the u s  isnt mandatory  and specific vaccine requirements by schools and employers are legal    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

by claim  viral whatsapp message claims taking pain relievers or anesthesia after covid    vaccination is dangerous and both should be avoided for two years  the claim that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided after vaccination is false and misleading as our findings and whos response shows this  aches or pain are common side effects of coronavirus  covid     vaccine  vaccination side effects show that the vaccine is teaching the immune system how to recognize and attack sars cov    the virus that causes covid      to relieve this pain  some vaccinated persons turn to pain relievers or killers  recent viral whatsapp message claims that pain relievers like diclofenac should be avoided for two years after taking covid    vaccine  according to this message  the adverse effects of the vaccine and pain relievers have been fatal  making reference to doctor who allegedly killed his wife by injecting her with diclofenac after covid    vaccination  pls if you have been vaccinated for covid    avoid diclofenac or any anaesthesia for the next two years  the adverse effects of the vaccine with these have been fatal  excerpt of the viral whatsapp message  taking close look at this claim  dubawa noted this claim sounded and looked like the one fact checked earlier in april        while the april claim says taking pain killers after receiving the covid    vaccine is dangerous and can lead to death  the recent claim says to avoid diclofenac and any other anesthesia if vaccinated Â  both claims seem to be tied to the same story of doctor who killed his wife by injecting her with dose of diclofenac after she had earlier received the covid    vaccine  dubawas earlier check however showed that the womans death was not vaccine related  dubawa conducted keyword search on anesthesia and pain relievers  anesthesia are medicines used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep to prevent pain and discomfort  this search led to checks by quint and india comÂ  discrediting the claim that getting anesthesia after vaccination is dangerousÂ  pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches  sore muscles  arthritis  or other aches and pains  there are different pain medicines  with advantages and risks Â  some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others and each person may also have slightly different response to pain reliever  pain relievers go by many names  analgesics  narcotics  painkillers  pain medicine etc  there are different types of pain relievers but they can be classified into two types  over the counter pain relievers and prescribed pain relievers  over the counter  otc   these are pain medications available at stores for any adult to purchase  they include  acetaminophen  nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  nsaids    under which ibuprofen and diclofenac fall under   combination drugs  contain both acetaminophen and aspirin  an nsaid   and topical  cream  gel  spray or patch  that can be applied directly to the skin  prescription  these medications are only available with prescription from healthcare provider as they provide stronger pain relief  they treat severe or chronic pain  these include  antidepressants  anti seizure medications  muscle relaxers  opioids  steroids and topical  look at studies and reports show that the arguments around pain relievers and vaccines is on the possibility of pain relievers curbing the necessary immune system response necessary to fight the virus like this study shows not on any health danger the centre for disease control  cdc  in its recent report in june on how to relieve covid    side effects warns against pain killers before vaccination but notes it can be taken afterwards with due consultation with your doctor  dubawa also reached out to persons who have been vaccinated in nigeria to get their experience if any with pain relievers  mr richard akinwunmi  who has gotten his complete dose  two dose  of the astrazeneca vaccine explained he took ibuprofen after his first dose and there was no adverse effect Â  for my first dose  no pain until the night of that day  i experienced heavy shoulder and muscle spasms so i took ibuprofen for   days and lot of water  for my second dose  i started feeling feverish  malaria kind  almost immediately and i took lot of water and paracetamol for   days  excerpt of mr richards response  alhassan bala on the other hand said he only took paracetamol  maybe because i am the type of person that hates pills  i only took paracetamol after i started experiencing fever few hours after the dose  the fever went away after about   hours  excerpt of alhassans response Â  just like alhassan  lateef sanni also took paracetamol which he said was recommended by the health officials where he got his vaccine and he was fine afterwards  i only took paracetamol if that qualifies as pain reliever  the doctors instructed that if i feel funny that i should use paracetamol  and that was what i did  immediately i took it  the malaria like symptoms i had disappeared  excerpt of mr lateefs response  speaking to health officials  dubawa gathered pain relievers can be taken after vaccination not before  medical officer  lynda effiong agim said it is not advisable to take pain relievers before vaccination but they can be taken afterwards as long as the person has no previous contraindication using nsaids  if the person previously had no contraindication to using nsaids then there is no issue because nsaids arent for everyone  however the nsaid is not to be taken in advance before vaccination  it is afterwards to help with pain  e t c  excerpt of dr lyndas comment  another health official  gynaecologist  dr monday idoko  at garki hospital abuja said the claim is not scientifically justifiable and if true maybe coincidence  on paracetamol which most of the vaccinated persons we spoke to said they took  he clarified it is also part of pain relievers  but the claims arent scientifically justifiable  it may be coincidence  diclofenac is an abused drug bought over the counter so if it were true  we would have had lot of these cases  excerpt of dr idokos comment  dubawa also reached out to the world health organisation  who  via email  the organisation responded saying there are no recommendations that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided for two years following vaccination  the who added that pain killers may be used for injection site pain following vaccination,[0. 0. 1.

source  jane ruby  stew peters  stew peters show    jul       Â     review    claims that study from the university of almerÃ­a in spain found graphene oxide in the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine have been circulating in spanish language telegram channels for weeks  these claims gained force in late june      when microscopy images allegedly comparing graphene oxide and the contents of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine from research study were posted on telegram channel  the claims have now spread through number of social media platforms  such as tiktok and facebook  and in number of languages including portuguese and now english Â Â  as part of the  coronavirusfacts alliance led by the international fact checking network  ifcn   which unites more than     fact checkers around the world in publishing  sharing and translating facts surrounding the new coronavirus  health feedback has translated the fact check for this claim  published by spanish fact checking organization newtral es  fellow signatory of the ifcn code of principles  you have asked us through our whatsapp verification service                    if it is true that the university of almerÃ­a  public university in almerÃ­a  spain  has published study that shows the presence of graphene in the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  this is false  although document concerning vaccines and graphene oxide on which the universitys seal appears has gone viral  this document isnt endorsed by the university of almerÃ­a  in fact  the academic institution has unequivocally distanced itself from this alleged study and its conclusions  the viral document is neither scientifically supported study nor does it provide conclusive evidence that the authorized covid    vaccines contain either graphene or graphene oxide  as claimed in different viral messages that have been disseminated with link to the document  the author of the report compared images obtained via electron microscopy  one of them is from sample of graphene oxide  and the other of liquid that  according to the document  could be the pfizer biontech vaccine  although the products origin and traceability is unknown  based on the scientific evidence available  experts who spoke to newtral es refuted that the authorized covid    vaccines are made with graphene  an ingredient that doesnt appear on the vaccines package inserts  which are rigorously reviewed by health authorities  the document you have asked us about  titled detection of graphene oxide in aqueous suspensions  cominarty  was published    june      and shared on various anti vaccine websites  comirnaty is the commercial name of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  but as we have already shown  there is no evidence that the liquid analyzed in the document is from this vaccine  the documents author acknowledges that vial arrived by courier service  but that he doesnt know its traceability  in addition  he also clarifies that the person who sent him this supposed vial is ricardo delgado martÃ­n  who has disseminated anti vaccine content  the document we are analyzing isnt published in prestigious scientific journal in its field  which provides quality seal to scientific work  there is also no evidence that the text has been validated by the scientific community through the process known as peer review  in which the methodology  interpretation  results  and conclusions are checked  as is made clear in the document  its an interim report whose objective is the microscopic identification of graphene derivatives in an alleged sample of the pfizer biontech vaccine  to do this  images of the sample  obtained through electron microscopy  are compared with images of reduced graphene oxide taken from the scientific literature  as stated in the publication  the images present high similarity to each other  therefore  from this comparison  it is concluded that the microscopic study of the sample provides evidence of the probable presence of graphene derivatives  however  the author proceeds to acknowledge that microcopy doesnt provide conclusive evidence and that the analyses in this report are from single  limited sample  it is therefore necessary to carry out significant sampling of similar vials to draw conclusions that can be generalized to comparable samples  recording origin  traceability and quality control during conservation and transport prior to analysis  the document highlights  ultimately  the publication doesnt provide conclusive evidence that the pfizer biontech vaccine contains graphene oxide  nor that it contains graphene  as claimed in anti vaccine messages  here you can access the package insert for the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  which lists the components of this vaccine  on page       health feedback  the full list of ingredients can be seen on page      newtral es has already explained that there is no evidence that the other authorized covid    vaccines contain graphene  as the president of the spanish vaccination association  amÃ³s garcÃ­a  explained to us  the individual who signs the report that we are verifying is pablo campra  researcher and professor at the university of almerÃ­a  campra himself highlights in the document that the results do not imply any position of the university of almerÃ­a and that neither he nor the university assume any responsibility for the content and opinion of third parties  however  because the universitys logo appears on the document  covid    denialist groups are sharing the alleged analysis of the vaccine as an official study from an academic institution  the university of almerÃ­a has already unequivocally distanced itself from the researchers conclusions in the document and  in fact  clarifies that it is not scientific study endorsed by the university  while reminding that the substance being analyzed is of unknown origin Â Â  comunicado de la universidad de almerÃ­a en relaciÃ³n con las falsas informaciones difundidas en

sources from the university confirmed to newtral es that the office of the universitys president has already contacted the researcher for having used the institutional image of the university in an analysis that  they insist  is not official nor is it part of scientific investigation endorsed by the institution  the statement clarifies that the university of almerÃ­a  as an academic institution  wholeheartedly supports vaccines as scientifically unquestionable instrument to fight against diseases  in the last few weeks  other messages claiming that there are studies proving that the authorized covid    vaccines contain graphene oxide have been shared  to support these claims  the messages include links to research article published on    may      in the scientific journal

aap  say that immunizing babies may be associated with lower risk of sids  dr rachel moon  who chairs the aap task force on sids  said that while there is overlap in the period of high risk for sids and frequent vaccinations for babies   multiple studies have looked at this relationship and found that there is no causal relationship  meaning that it s coincidence in timing    there is no increased risk of sids when you get the vaccines  and actually  the studies suggest that babies who are vaccinated are at lower risk of sids  that may be because if you ve been recently ill  you re more likely to die from sids  vaccinated babies are less likely to get ill  for multiple reasons   she added  also read  unrelated images falsely shared as blood cells damages by covid    vaccine dr robert jacobson  pediatrician at mayo clinic  agreed   if anything  we see lower rates of sudden infant death among infants vaccinated than in infants who have foregone the vaccinations   he said  while this reduction may not be directly due to vaccination   there s no data that has shown any one of the vaccines actually increases your risk of sudden infant death syndrome   he said  social

social media posts cite study by dr william torch to back the claim that vaccines cause sids  but the      study was challenged by researchers  and torch himself admitted it was difficult to draw

schedule for vaccines is similar to that of the us  with multiple shots recommended for babies between two and four months  japanese law was indeed amended in      to make vaccination more of civic

authorization or approval  followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects  in addition  the food and drug administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high quality and free of contaminants  one key vaccine safety surveillance program is the vaccine adverse event reporting system  or vaers  which is an early warning system run by the centers for disease control and prevention and fda  as its website explains  vaers is not designed to detect if vaccine caused an adverse event  but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring closer look  anyone can submit report to vaers for any health problem that occurs after an immunization  there is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem  the information is still valuable because its way of being quickly alerted to potential safety issue with vaccine  which can then be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people  which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts  revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits

product is      safe  but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval  followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects  in addition  the food and drug administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high quality and free of contaminants  one key vaccine safety surveillance program is the vaccine adverse event reporting system  or vaers  which is an early warning system run by the centers for disease control and prevention and fda  as its website explains  vaers is not designed to detect if vaccine caused an adverse event  but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring closer look  anyone can submit report to vaers for any health problem that occurs after an immunization  there is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem  the information is still valuable because its way of being quickly alerted to potential safety issue with vaccine  which can then be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people

in recent weeks  many states began relaxing coronavirus restrictions as covid    cases dropped and vaccinationÂ rates crept toward president joe biden s target of partially vaccinating     of american adults by july    the u s  is expected to fall short of that goal  and now the nation faces anotherÂ setback  the spread of the contagious delta variant  it now accounts for at least     of covid    cases and is on the rise Â  variants aren t unexpected  wheneverÂ a virus replicates inside its host  random genetic errors  resulting in slightly altered versions of the original Â are common occurrence  since the start of the pandemic  there have been thousands of coronavirus mutations Â some strains  like the delta variant  are more contagious than others  but some on social media are claiming cases fromÂ the new strain aren t due to the virus but shedding from covid    vaccines   the new  variant  is nothing more than the vx spike pr teins inf cting those vxd and unvxd   Â claims tweet shared in june   Â instagram post  both twitter and instagram accounts are owned by the same user  who usa today has reachedÂ out toÂ for comment Â  the tweet perpetuates widely circulating  but grossly incorrect theory that the spike protein generated by the covid    vaccinesÂ can somehow cause disease or be shed and affect surrounding unvaccinated individuals  fact check  mers and covid    are related coronaviruses but not the same neither is possible  the covid    vaccines simply help the body develop immunity against the virus  including against the delta variant Â Â  vaccine shedding can occurÂ in rare casesÂ with some types of vaccines  but not with the ones currently available for covid      as none of the current covid    vaccines authorized for emergency use in the usa contain live sars cov   virus  viral shedding is not an issue for these vaccines   dr  matthew laurens  an infectious disease specialist and vaccine researcher at the university of maryland school of medicine  previously told usa today  the vaccines authorized in the u s  contain instructions for the spike protein either in the form ofÂ messenger rna  type of genetic code ordinarily used by our bodies to make proteins  or via weakened cold virus strippedÂ of its ability to replicate  regardless of the delivery system  the spike protein cannot cause disease on its own  when coronavirus enters your body  usually through breathing in virus laden droplets from other infected people Â the infection unfolds like this  the virus binds to protein on the host cell surface  entersÂ the host cell  replicates  destroys the host cell as new viral particles are made andÂ dumped into the bloodstream Â  fact check  coronavirus variants come from mutations  not vaccines vaccine s spike protein can t do any of this since it s genetically engineered to only enhance an immune response  is extremely localized once injected and lacks the genetic code to assemble fully formed viral particle  once antibodies against it are made  the spike protein is mostly broken down by the host cell Â  emerging in india this year  the delta variant is the newest variant of concern  what the u s  centers for disease control and prevention is calling group of coronavirus strains that appear to be more transmissible and result in more severe disease Â especially for those who haven t beenÂ vaccinated  experts say Â  what makes the delta variant so contagious and worrisome to scientists are two mutations that enable easy viral transmission  it s reported toÂ beÂ     more transmissible than the dominant alpha variant  and immune system evasion Â  this poses grave concern and threat to poor countries with little to no vaccines  as well asÂ vulnerable areasÂ in the southern u s  where vaccination rates severely lag behind the northeast and west coast Â   variant like  delta  that has more transmissibility will lead to more hospitalizations and more deaths among population that has low vaccination coverage   dr  henry walke  director of the cdc s division of preparedness and emerging infections  told nbc news  fact check  claims about who guidance for vaccinating children are missing context the key protection againstÂ this contagious strain is being fully vaccinated Â  may study from the u k  s public health england showed two doses of the pfizer biontech vaccine were     effective against symptomatic disease from the delta variant  and even more successful at preventing hospitalization and death  the study  however  found one dose of the pfizer vaccine was only     protective  data on how protective the moderna or johnson   johnson vaccine is against the new variant is still in the works  but experts sayÂ booster shots likely might provide broader protection  including against the delta variant  Â Â  we rate the claim that the spike protein of the covid    vaccines is the cause of the new delta variant false  based on our research  the delta variant is genetically

prashant bhushan s recent posts about the safety and efficacy of the covid    vaccines have been criticised by many  micro blogging platform twitter on monday     june  labelled senior sc advocate prashant bhushan s tweets on covid    vaccines as  misleading   bhushan s recent tweets about the safety and efficacy of the covid    vaccines and the coronavirus induced lockdowns have garnered widespread criticism   in the tweet that was flagged by twitter  bhushan had said  the healthy young have hardly any chance of serious effects or dying due to covid  they have higher chance of dying due to vaccines  the covid recovered have much better natural immunity  than the vaccine gives them  vaccines may even compromise their acquired natural immunity  we spoke with doctors and health experts who said that the claims and assertions made by bhushan were neither correct nor backed by evidence  we also found several studies in reputed medical journals that contradicted some of the claims put forth by bhushan  while it is true that the fatalities in the younger age groups  less than     is comparatively less than the elderly  but the number of young people who got infected during this phase increased substantially    we spoke with dr narinder kumar mehra  indian council of medical research emeritus scientist  hon  and former dean of the aiims  new delhi about bhushan s assertions  he agrees that younger adults were less affected by covid       however  this is not reason for young people to not get vaccinated  specially since they can still be asymptomatic carriers and infect others with lower immunity   he adds   during an earlier conversation with fit  dr rakesh mishra  former director of csir centre for cellular and molecular biology in hyderabad said  we haven t seen anything in the virus that indicates it prefers certain age groups   dr giridhar babu  epidemiologist and professor at public health foundation of india  also said   the virus will seek those who are uninfected  so any age group that is uninfected or unvaccinated  the virus will find them when it transmits  these people  who we call susceptible  are at risk of catching the virus in the future waves   bhushan also said that younger adults had higher chance of dying due to vaccines  there is no proof or evidence to support this claim  as of    june  over    crore people in the age group of       have been vaccinated  government data shows   dr mehra said that aefis are not unique to covid     aefis have been recorded after all kinds of vaccinations for very long time    only those who have allergic reactions are at risk from vaccinations and to ensure that it does not affect the recipient  they are kept under observation for    minutes   dr mehra added  as per the cdc   more than     million doses of covid    vaccines were administered in the united states from    december       through    june       during this time  vaers received       reports of death         percent  among people who received covid    vaccine    however  in most cases the cause of death has not been directly linked to the covid    vaccine   report published on    june in ap said that  nearly all covid    deaths in the united states now are in people who werent vaccinated   an archive of the post can be found here   source  twitter screenshot  this claim is inaccurate and misleading  although rare  cases of reinfections in covid    recovered patients is possible and has happened   study on covid    reinfections  first published in the british medical journal  bmj  in january said that   to date  most of the sars cov   reinfections that have been reported have been milder than first encounters with the virus  although some have been more harmful  and two people have died as result   study published in nature journal found that antibodies from covid    infection could possibly last lifetime  however  the paper mentioned that the emergence of variants of covid    would mean that the protective response of antibodies will be reduced and people will need vaccinations to restore the antibody levels   those impacted by covid    also experience lingering effects of the disease  phenomenon known as  long covid   case study found that those suffering from long covid experience relief after getting vaccinated   dr mehra says that the bottom line should be that everyone needs to be vaccinated  in the same tweet thread  bhushan said   the  indian  govt is not monitoring adverse events from vaccine nor releasing data   after an initial delay in reporting of adverse events following immunisation  aefi   the mohfw is now updating the details of adverse events reported after people were administered with the covid    vaccine   the ministry uploads pdfs on its website that details adverse events among people  and assesses the causal relationship between the vaccine and the side effects  the national adverse event following immunisation  aefi  committee for covid    then studies the reports and determines whether the vaccine caused the adverse events or not  the number of adverse side effects are also reported through the co win platform  as per   june document   the reporting rate  in india  is     deaths per million vaccine doses administered and     hospitalisations per million vaccine doses administered   this data was from the aefis studies between february april   dr nk arora  member of the national aefi adverse events following immunisation  aefi  committee also said that all states will be asked to update data on aefis and make it public  the panel has so far reported only one death that can be directly linked to the vaccine     year old man died due to anaphylaxis  severe allergic reaction  after being vaccinated on   march  report in the hindu said   bhushan repeated claim by self described independent virologist and vaccine expert geert vanden bossche that said that mass vaccinations using the currently available vaccines will create more virulent mutants   an archive of the post can be found here   source  twitter screenshot  in the    minute long video shared by bhushan  bossche makes several false or misleading claims about covid    vaccinations  possible mutations and loss of innate immunity because of vaccinations combined with lockdowns   fit had previously debunked these claims by bossche after speaking with experts in immunology and virology   we spoke with dr satyajit rath  an adjunct faculty of iiser pune and an immunologist  who said   if most people are  immune  to the original virus strain  then the original strain cannot establish infection easily  but variants that are not as sensitive to that immunity might then get an advantage and will begin to spread    health desk  covid    resource for journalists powered by public health experts dismissed the claim by bossche on losing innate immunity and explained   studies have shown that when infants and children are raised in home that is too clean  they may be more likely to have allergies or autoimmune problems later on  this hygiene hypothesis causes confusion sometimes  the hypothesis does not mean that the immune system needs to be exposed to germs all the time to remain strong   it is also important to note that bossche s work  which is not published in any reputed peer reviewed journal  is often cited by anti vaxxers such as bigtree  wakefield  and robert f kennedy junior  apart from tweeting about the harmful effects of vaccinations  bhushan has also been strong critic of covid induced lockdowns and masking guidelines   on    april  bhushan posted message on his social media handles that said that face masks are ineffective against covid    based on study by us based cardiologist  the paper was also shared by other social media users with similar claim  twitter later removed bhushans post as it did not meet its community standards and covid    guidelines   many of the references cited in the paper also talked about the effectiveness of masks in preventing covid    transmission  the who  the us centers for disease control and prevention and the indian council of medical research  icmr

a system that public health officials use to track vaccine side effects is once again being used to spread misinformation about the safety of the coronavirus vaccines Â  the vaccine adverse reporting

news host tucker carlsonÂ featured the number of deaths reported to vaersÂ in may   segment of  tucker carlson tonight   between late december of       and  april   total of       people apparently died after getting the covid vaccines in the united states   carlson said on the show Â  more recently Â the number of deaths associated with covid    vaccines came up in an article published by conservativeÂ websiteÂ envolve  theÂ may    story  which doesn t have byline Â cites carlsons figure and says in itsÂ headline that  the death tollÂ fromÂ covid vaccines is greater than every vaccineÂ inÂ theÂ last    years combined  Â  more thanÂ       facebook usersÂ haveÂ shared the piece  according toÂ crowdtangle Â a social media insights tool Â  but the article is based on falsehood  fact check  covid    vaccines don t produce dangerous toxins deaths reported to vaersÂ are not  death toll   theÂ databaseÂ includes all serious adverse events following vaccination against covid     regardless of whether the vaccines are to blame Â there have been more deaths reported to vaers following covid    vaccination than for other vaccines  but experts told usa today that s not because the vaccines are deadly Â anti vaccine advocates have erroneously cited the database for decades  statements that imply that deaths following vaccination equate to deaths caused by vaccination are scientifically inaccurate  misleading  and irresponsible  dr  tom shimabukuro  deputy director of the centers for disease control and prevention s immunization safety office  told usa today in an email Â vaccines are one of the tools that are going to help the u s  get back to normal life  vaccines save lives  cdc recommends that everyone who is eligible should get vaccinated  usa today reached out to envolve for comment  in       the food and drug administration created vaers  the goal was to set upÂ a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u s  licensed vaccines   vaersÂ relies on healthcare providers  vaccine manufacturers and vaccine recipients to submit reports of adverse eventsÂ following vaccination Â those eventsÂ are not called symptoms or side effects because events reported to vaers areÂ not all verifiably linked toÂ the vaccines  as the cdc says on itsÂ website  theseÂ reportsÂ areÂ relatively rareÂ forÂ fda approved vaccines Â between            vaers received       reports of death after vaccination  according to usa today analysis of vaers data Â  that isn t the case with the covid    vaccines  which the fda approved via emergency use authorization  since clinical trials for the covid    vaccines began  vaers has receivedÂ more than       reports of death following vaccination Â that may sound like big number Â but since all vaers data isn t vetted  those reportsÂ do not proveÂ Â aÂ causal link between covid    vaccination and death  as usa today previously reported  so why the discrepancy in death reports  one reason for the inflated reports of death following covid    vaccination isÂ  that healthcare providers are required to report all serious adverse events  regardless of whether they think they re related to the shot  healthcare providers reporting requirements  for covid    vaccines Â are much broader than for other vaccines Â shimabukuro told usa today  after someone receives covid    vaccine  their healthcare provider is required by lawÂ to report allÂ serious adverse healthÂ events  even if the provider does not think the vaccine caused that event Â these eventsÂ can includeÂ death  inpatient hospitalization or serious case of covid    Â that reporting protocolÂ is due to the fact that the fda authorizedÂ the covid    vaccinesÂ for emergency use Â  forÂ other vaccinesÂ Â such asÂ theÂ flu vaccineÂ and theÂ measles Â mumps and rubella vaccinesÂ Â the requirements are different Â according to shimabukuro  providers do not have to reportÂ deaths or other adverse eventsÂ for fda approved vaccines unless they fit specific criteriaÂ of reportable events Â  anyone can submit adverse events following vaccination to vaers  experts say that could result in reporting bias  anyone can reportÂ data to the system Â including vaccine manufacturers  clinical providers  parents  patientsÂ  anyone  lili zhao  research associate professor in the biostatisticsÂ department at the university of michigan s school of public health  told usa today  as long as the event happened after the vaccination  cdc encourages you to record it  according to zhao Â this makesÂ the system vulnerable to reporting bias  becauseÂ covid    vaccines have attractedÂ more attention from the media and the public  people may be more likely to report events to vaers than they would for other vaccines  in other words  the unique circumstances around the worldwide pandemic mean comparing vaers reports around covid    to those from any prior vaccine  as the facebookÂ post does  is far from an apples to apples situation  fact check  cdc data on adverse effects of vaccine cannot determine cause and just because anÂ adverse event is listed in the vaers database doesn t mean vaccines are to blame  maybe the patient had diabetes  or maybeÂ  they Â had late stageÂ cancer  they receive vaccine  and maybe after two months  the patient dies   zhao said Â  it was not due to the vaccine  but because it occurred after the vaccine  it is okÂ to report Â  envolve claimedÂ there have been more deaths due to the coronavirus vaccines than any other vaccine in the past    years  but that s wrongÂ  covid    vaccines have not been definitively linked to death  Â vaers is not designed to determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event  while some reported adverse events may be caused by vaccination  others are not and may have occurred coincidentally Â shimabukuroÂ said  more than     million covid    vaccines have now administered in the u s   an enormous vaccinated group within which all manner of disease and death naturally occurs  someone dying or developing particular symptom after being vaccinated doesn t mean those two events are related  even though there are broader reportingÂ requirements for covid    vaccines  adverse event reports are investigated just as they are for any other vaccine  this means that following report  the vaers staff and cdcs immunization safety office examine medical recordsÂ such as autopsies and hospital records Â Â  public health officials investigate adverse event reports submitted to vaers Â the cdcs immunization safety office examines medical records  such as autopsies and hospital records Â to determine if the reports are credible  with this protocol  the cdc and vaers were able to detect that the johnson   johnsonÂ vaccine was linked to rare kind of blood clot that killed three people Â outside of those deaths  shimabukuro said  theÂ cdc has not detected any unusual or unexpected patterns for deaths following immunization that would indicate that covid    vaccines are causing or contributing to deaths Â  theÂ claim that the  death toll of covid    vaccines is more than    times higher than that of past vaccines is false  based on our research  deaths reported to vaers for the covid    vaccines do outnumber reports for past vaccines  but those reports have not been verified as being causally related  anyone can submit adverse events to vaers  making the system susceptible to reporting bias  experts say  healthcare providers are also required to report adverse events following covid    vaccination  even if the provider does not think the vaccine caused the event,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

https   t co wifljanzqp  the wife scientific   profkatieewer  june           following an expression of concern by the journal on    june      regarding the studys misinterpretation of the data and the conclusions  the study was ultimately retracted on   july       the journals editorial board explained that the decision was taken to retract as the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings and that the authors were asked to respond to the claims  but were not able to do so satisfactorily  this review explains why the methodology used by the authors is flawed and misleading  ultimately giving readers the false impression that the vaccines risks are equal to or greater than its benefits  to calculate the number of deaths caused by covid    vaccination  walach et al  used post vaccine adverse event reports in the dutch pharmacovigilance database lareb  this system is similar to the u s  vaccine adverse events reporting system  as has been pointed out on several occasionsand on the lareb website  see translation in english post vaccination adverse event reports alone dont constitute evidence that the vaccine was the cause  however  the manner in which these reports were used by walach et al   such as their labeling of adverse event reports of death as deaths by vaccination  demonstrates that the authors attributed causality to the vaccines based solely on these reports  in the authors response to the retraction of their study  reported by retraction watch  they defended the manner in which they used the database  stating that although the self reporting system of side effects for vaccines and other drugs is far from foolproof  it is the only data we have  so why should it not be put to use  this line of questioning appears to imply that adverse event reports arent used to study potential causal associations  when in fact public health agencies are using such reports to do so  this is evident from the associations observed between blood clots and viral vector vaccines like the astrazeneca oxford vaccine  as well as heart inflammation and rna vaccines like the pfizer biontech vaccine  these associations have been widely reported in the media  see here  here  here  and here   what sets these investigations by public health agencies apart from that of walach et al  is that they also involved comparisons with baseline incidences of such events  examples can be seen in these reports here and here by the u s  centers for disease control and prevention Â  this is an important step  because even before covid    vaccines were available  cases of blood clots  heart inflammation  and death already occurred at certain rate in the population  in order to assess the plausibility of causal association between an event and vaccine  one must first determine if the incidence of an event is higher in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people  walach et al  didnt conduct such comparisons and failed to show that death occurred at higher frequency in vaccinated people  furthermore  previous investigations by health authorities showed that deaths arent more frequent among vaccinated people as compared to unvaccinated people  the authors measured vaccine effectiveness by calculating the number needed to vaccinate  nntv  sometimes abbreviated to nnv   nntv originates from an epidemiological metric known as number needed to treat  nnt   in simple terms  nnt is the number of people that need to be treated in order to avoid specific bad outcome  like death  if drug has an nnt of    it means you have to treat   people with the drug to prevent one additional bad outcome  in the same vein  nntv is the number of people that need to be vaccinated in order to avoid bad outcome  e g  death   we can calculate nntv by dividing   with the absolute risk reduction  arr   arr is calculated by subtracting the rate of the bad outcome in the treated group from that of the control  untreated  group  for example  if the rate of the bad outcome in an untreated group is      but the rate in treated group is     then the arr is five              the authors use of nntv  value derived from arr  as measure of vaccine effectiveness is incorrect  this is because arr doesnt account for indirect benefits of vaccines and is influenced by factors like disease prevalence  as explained in an earlier health feedback review  which can change independently of vaccine effectiveness  vaccinologist and associate professor at the university of auckland helen petousis harris pointed out in blog post that vaccine effectiveness is never calculated by using an nnt nnv  it cannot account for the effect on transmission and herd effects of vaccines  since vaccines help population to approach herd immunity  the more people in population are vaccinated  the fewer opportunities disease has to spread  this directly impacts disease prevalence in populationthe higher the number of vaccinated people  the higher the nntv  that is  more people need to be vaccinated to prevent bad outcome  the high nntv isnt because the vaccine is ineffective  but because the probability of someone getting the disease is now lower due to herd immunity  which in turn makes the number of specific bad outcome even smaller  another factor that influences nntv is time  the nntv calculation by walach et al  was made using data from study conducted in israel which lasted for just six weeks     therefore  the nntv calculated by walach et al  only reflects the level of benefit over six weeks rather than over the long run  but since vaccines can provide benefits in the long term  using data derived from short term study to infer vaccines benefits can make vaccine seem less promising than the effect that vaccine would have on persons risk over longer period of time  as explained by health experts at meedan health desk  epidemiologist gideon meyerowitz katz highlighted the same issue on twitter    n this means that the nntv from this study is inherently misleading unless you assume that vaccines will stop working entirely after the   week period  obviously false   health nerd   gidmk  june           and finally  the prevalence of an infectious disease can be reduced by measures taken to mitigate the spread of the disease  such as physical distancing and mask wearing  as pointed out by health experts at meedan health desk  when this happens  the arr calculated for vaccine can be small  this isnt because vaccine is ineffective  rather  it is because the number of cases occurring in community is small  conversely  when the spread of disease is high  the number of cases that occuras well as the bad outcome associated with that diseasealso rises  this leads to higher arr  this shows how arr can change not because the vaccines intrinsic effectiveness changes  but as result of differences in epidemiological situations  these factors illustrate how nntv can differ independently of vaccine effectiveness  making its use as such by walach et al  incorrect  in the end  the study by walach et al  failed to address the aim stated in the introduction of their study  which is to determine the effectiveness of the vaccines and to compare them with the costs in terms of side effects  the use of adverse event reports as evidence of vaccine harm is incorrect and misleading  since adverse event reports alone arent proof of causality  and the authors didnt conduct additional investigations that were needed to infer causation  and as explained above  the nntv doesnt measure vaccine effectiveness and its use as such in the study is incorrect  in fact  petousis harris called the studys results completely meaningless  the data were inappropriately interpreted to represent vaccine reactions  events caused by administration of vaccine  and    the methods used to calculate risk benefit were also inappropriate approaches to address the research objectives  garbage went in  got statistically abused  and what came out  at  the end was nonsense  factcheck org also assessed the same claim and concluded that the study misinterpreted data and was

an instagram post cites canadian pathologists purported claim that men who receive covid    vaccine will lose their reproductive capacity  which could spell the end of having children altogether  the june    post by an australian user includes photo of man clutching his groin next to caption with the headline  uk pathologist warns spike proteins will cause all men to lose their reproductive capacity  the mrna vaccines is  sic  found also to damage mens reproductive organs  warns dr  roger hodkinson of western medical assessments  the vaccine spike proteins express themselves both in the placenta and the testes  the caption says  for pregnant women  this could mean terminated pregnancy  for men  it could spell the end of having children altogether  people who get the jabs are going to regret it  dr  hodkinson warns  because many  if not all  of them will lose their reproductive capacity  the post includes link to an article from the european union times  long standing source of misinformation  extensively quoting dr hodkinson  at the time of writing  the post had been viewed more than        times  variations of the same claims have been shared in countries such as canada  estonia and the uk  there is no credible research that supports the claim that mrna covid    vaccines cause damage to male reproductive organs and cause men to become infertile  the instagram post and linked article claim dr hodkinson  canadian pathologist who has been quoted as describing covid    as hoax  said there was sufficient evidence in the literature to suggest that spike proteins resulting from mrna vaccines express themselves both in the placenta and the testes  however  dr hodkinson told aap factcheck in an email that there were substantial inaccuracies in the european union times article including some things i did not say at all  he declined to state which parts were inaccurate and instead referred to an interview posted on lewrockwell com  which frequently publishes anti vaccination and conspiratorial material  in the interview  dr hodkinson said there were serious scientific grounds for concern about the vaccines and male fertility  but he concedes these concerns were not proven    min   sec   he later claims there is scientific evidence in the literature for concern about the consequences of the vaccine targeting the ovaries and the spike proteins targeting the testes without providing further details    min   sec   professor david tscharke  virologist and immunologist at the australian national university  anu   described the claim that spike proteins from vaccines inhibit reproductive function as made up and extremely unlikely  unlike sars cov    the virus that causes covid      which is replicating infectious agent that can spread systemically  none of the vaccines are able to spread far from the site of injection and none disseminate through the body  he told aap factcheck in an email  there is no plausible mechanism by which spike protein alone would disturb the function of the testes  professor mark hedger  the head of the laboratory of endocrinology and immunophysiology at melbournes hudson institute of medical research  told aap factcheck there was no evidence in medical literature to show that covid    vaccines would leave men infertile  theyve been doing clinical trials for    months  if it was problem  it would have been reported by now  prof hedger said in phone interview  we already know about blood clots  and theyre extremely rare events  and the sort of thing that were talking about here is an effect on fertility which would probably also be an extremely rare event if it was to occur  but theres just been no mention of it  the article quotes dr hodkinson as saying that excess spike proteins generated by covid    vaccines circulate in the testes  impairing reproductive function due to the presence of ace  receptors  ace  enzymes are responsible for regulating various body processes  such as blood pressure  however in cases of coronavirus infection the virus attaches to the enzyme and inhibits its normal activities  leading to higher risk of tissue damage in organs such as the heart and lungs  however  gaetan burgio  geneticist and infectious diseases researcher also at anu  told aap factcheck in an email there is no evidence to date that excess spike proteins from the vaccines have been observed in reproductive organs  the vaccine only produces the key protein for viral infection  spike protein  and not the entire virus  studies have demonstrated the virus needs to be produced to invade the tissue in the testes  therefore the spike protein alone is not sufficient to bind ace  receptors in the testes  dr burgio said  an israeli study  which is yet to be peer reviewed  into the pfizer vaccines effect on male fertility concluded the vaccine does not affect sperm whereas sars cov   infection does impair sperm  us study looking at the effect of mrna vaccines on sperm quality in men concluded there were no significant decreases in any sperm parameter among this small cohort of healthy men  this is the full life cycle of sperm and    days is sufficient time to see if the vaccine impacts semen parameters  daniel c  gonzalez  one of the studys authors  said in statement  we measured semen volume  sperm concentration  and the total amount of moving sperm and found there were no declines in any of the parameters as compared to the baseline analysis  studies and reviews published in journals such as nature  reproduction and journal of medical virology have suggested potential link between covid    infection  not vaccination  and reduction in mens fertility  although there is currently no evidence of long term impacts  associate professor peter illingworth  the

is this video correct in suggesting there s  we know  consensus that mrna vaccines against covid    cause the body to create  very dangerous  toxic proteins  no  that s not true  there s no peer reviewed medical study proving this assertion has been accepted  the cdc rejects the claim  saying there is no medical evidence to support it  part of the claim rests on remarks made on radio talk show by veterinary school professor whose university does not endorse his declaration that the spike proteins dangerously spread through patients  organs  part of the claim relies on japanese language document that is not  as the video host claims  proof the spike protein runs free upon injection  medical experts who have been studying and fighting the pandemic for more than year have not reported in actively edited science journals that the spike is free roaming and lethal  and the final point of the video  that people who suffer adverse reactions won t report them due to social pressure is illogical  given that any person with computer can report an adverse reaction via the federal government s vaccine safety monitoring system from their couch  whether they are the doctor  patient  family member or friend  the claims were made in youtube video  archived here  published by evolutionary biologist bret weinstein s  dark horse  podcast on june           titled  spike protein is very dangerous  it s cytotoxic   the text introduction begins  click below to watch the video on youtube     robert malone s supporters  claim  archived here  that he was intellectually  raped  at the salk institute  but the virginia based md pharmaceutical expert s claim that he invented mrna vaccine technology is not recognized by independent authors writing about development of the ground breaking method  this fact check instead focuses on his claims  with the engineer and evolutionary biologist in the video  about purported lethality of spike proteins  spike proteins are the key to the success of the mrna vaccine  they deliver kind of biological software that induces patients  cells at the injection site to create the spiky sphere found on the sars cov   coronavirus  recognized as foreign invader  the spike protein triggers patients  immune systems  building antigens that will then attack the virus if the patient is infected by the virus that causes covid     the vaccine has been found to cause humans to build very specific antigen to fight the virus  in the introduction to the podcast episode  weinstein says  starting at    seconds and continuing to about two minutes    seconds  there s little doubt guest steve kirsch has uncovered serious problem  the video s claims are addressed below with hyperlinks to the relevant time code  which permits readers to immediately hear the claim themselves  at five minutes    seconds  after telling an anecdote about an acquaintance he says had heart attack immediately after having the pfizer mrna vaccine  video host weinstein says   the spike protein itself we now know is very dangerous  it s cytotoxic   his guest  malone  agrees  saying the food and drug administration  fda  rebuffed his warnings about the risk  months and months ago   kirsch  tech entrepreneur who has built and sold several companies  is also on the set with them  fda press officer abby capobianco said in june          email to lead stories that there s no support for the claim  she wrote  there is no scientific data to indicate that the spike protein in mrna vaccines is toxic or that it lingers at any toxic level in the body after vaccination  as with many other vaccines  covid    vaccines can cause some side effects  most side effects of vaccines  including covid    vaccines  are usually minor and short lived  for example  person may feel soreness at the injection site or experience mild fever  serious vaccine reactions are not common  but they can happen  the side effects that people may experience in the first few days following any vaccine is part of the body s immune response to the vaccine  however  it is important to note that side effects following vaccination  or lack of side effects  do not correlate with the effectiveness of vaccine in an individual   lead stories searched the national institutes of health indexes of science journals and found no peer reviewed studies that would support weinstein s implication  in word and tone  that there is consensus view of the spike protein as dangerous  in june           email to lead stories  pfizer spokesman said clinical testing and follow up with test subjects shows the opposite  there is no evidence of harmful quantities of toxicity in humans from the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  all adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed by pfizer as well as by regulatory authorities such as the ema  fda and cdc  with more than     million doses of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine administered globally  the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive  at two minutes     seconds  weinstein says   something has gone wrong  we are in danger  as summary of what computer engineer tech entrepreneur medical philanthropist kirsch has written in his blog  kirsch agrees  he says he grew suspicious of the vaccine when his  unnamed  carpet cleaner told him he got the pfizer vaccine and had heart attack  two minutes later  and that the carpet cleaner s wife also had an adverse reaction  hand tremor she had never before had   that is like lightning striking twice in the same place   kirsch then says   if it s really safe vaccine then what i just saw was impossible   even after subsequent discussion of the inherent flaws of anecdotal evidence and correct sampling method     which are bedrock principles of scientific research    weinstein says his objection to the vaccine rests in part on finding nearly everyone he has talked to has had serious adverse reaction to the vaccine  medical experts have repeatedly cautioned against assuming correlation proves causation during vaccine campaign  with hundreds of millions of doses administered  people with pre existing health conditions are likely to coincidentally have health episodes that are unrelated to the vaccine  more than     million doses of covid vaccine had been administered as of june           the centers for disease control and prevention reports on its covid vaccine safety webpage  with what the cdc calls the most thorough vaccine monitoring campaign in history  it has found rare serious adverse reactions  anaphylaxis  similar to the allergic reaction to bee sting  and thrombosis  clotting disorder that has hit handful of women out of the millions vaccinated  the cdc and fda s adverse reaction reporting system has not proven  and cannot prove  any of the claims kirsch makes about vaccines causing deaths and injury  as lead stories has reported before  the vaccine adverse event reporting system does not collect verified reports  it is messy  likely repetitive list of reports that anyone can make if they own computer  it serves as starting point for investigators  raising questions that must be researched and not simply answered from crowd sourced list of complaints  kirsch  at six minutes     seconds  says his belief is also supported by byram bridle  ontario veterinary college professor of viral immunology  kirsch says bridle demanded  through the equivalent of the freedom of information act  documentation from japanese regulatory authorities that shows pfizer has data showing the spike proteins don t stay where they are supposed to and course throughout the body  especially accumulating in the ovaries  in his june           email to lead stories  the pfizer spokesman said the document  written in japanese  is publicly available report on testing of the mrna vaccine on mice and rats  he said kirsch s description does not match what the document in question shows  the document is known as common technical document which is an internationally recognized standard format for submissions to regulatory authorities  its use is required for prescription drugs in japan and elsewhere  the document is publicly available part of the data submission applied by pfizer to pmda for its review the document provides pharmacokinetics overview from early laboratory studies in both mice and rats  assessing how the then investigational covid    vaccine moved through the animals  simply put  the study showed benign safety profile with just the expected inflammation associated with an immune response to the vaccine  in his may          article  organic chemist derek lowe  ph d  who works in drug development  not for pfizer nor moderna   said the image of spike proteins tumbling through the body ignores the process by which the proteins are made and hosted in the body    instead of that being assembled into more infectious viral particles  as would happen in real coronavirus infection  this protein gets moved up to the surface of the cell  where it stays  that s where it s presented to the immune system  as an abnormal intruding protein on cell surface  the spike protein is not released to wander freely through the bloodstream by itself  because it has transmembrane anchor region that  as the name implies  leaves it stuck  that s how it sits in the virus itself  and it does the same in human cells  the fda s documents laying out support for use of the moderna  pfizer and janssen mrna vaccines to fight the pandemic do not support bridle s claims that the vaccines sicken patients  based on tracking the effects on tens of thousands of patients  the fda found the benefits of the vaccines outweigh potential harms  the janssen vaccine was briefly put on hold to investigate half dozen clotting issues out of millions of patients vaccinated  after developing specific warnings for doctors and patients  the vaccine was released for use again  lead stories reached out to the cdc on june,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.

factcrescendo sri lanka  english the fact behind every news  at time where only small percentage of total population has been vaccinated against covid    in sri lanka  viral whatsapp forward which claimed the life threatening risk of anesthetics after vaccination  has caused further agitation in the community  fact crescendo sri lankas investigation into this viral claim proved this was yet another claim which was infusing fear among the society which could even increase the hesitancy to get vaccinated  social media posts  whatsapp forward claiming that the taking any form vaccines before   weeks from covid    vaccination  went viral in sri lanka as seen below   vaccination warning Â anyone who has been vaccinated against coronavirus is prohibited from taking any type of anesthetic  even local anesthetics or dentists anesthetics  because this poses great danger to the life of the vaccinated person and is highly dangerous Â  there is possibility of death therefore  the vaccinated person must wait   weeks after the vaccination  if he has reaction  he can administer anesthetic only   weeks after the antibody develops Â  pharmacys friend relative was vaccinated two days ago  he went to the dentist yesterday and died immediately after receiving local anesthetics Â  after reading the warning about the coronavirus vaccination in the vaccine box  we discovered that after the coronavirus vaccine was given  there was warning not to take anesthetics Â please spread this information to protect your family  relatives  friends and everyone  the viral message claims that the reason for person having to wait at least   weeks is for the body to develop antibodies  the message cites an example of person who had died after receiving local anesthetics at dental clinic and also states that there was warning in the vaccine box saying not to take anesthetics as well  also read different versions of this message was shared in facebook  twitter and other social media platforms as well  below is tweet from sri lankan user  tweet   archived fact checkÂ  an anesthetic is drug used to prevent pain during medical procedures by acting on certain nerve pathways to prevent the nerves in the area from sending signals to the brain  it usually takes few minutes for the drug to take effect  and it wears off after few hours  more on uses  types  and risks of local anesthesia is seen here  fact crescendo sri lanka team consulted dr  ashan pathirana from health promotions bureau and we were told that there is no scientific basis in the viral claim and that research so far has not shown any relationship between vaccination and use of anesthetics Â  furthermore  he said that there is no such warning as indicated in the viral message  issued by epidemilogy unit in sri lanka either  dr  ananda wijewickrama  consultant physician at infectious disease hospital also dismissed the claims given in the viral message as baseless  who sri lanka office also confirmed that no warning had been issued by who with respect to covid   vaccines and anesthesia  next we looked at how some of the foreign health officials had responded to these claims  also read  according to the saudi ministry of health  there are no adverse effects receivingÂ local or general anesthesia for recently vaccinated patients  including those who received vaccinations for the coronavirus as reported by arab news  malaysian society of anesthesiologists had also issued statement with respect to anaesthesia requirements of vaccinated individuals  while strongly refuting the misleading message circulating on the social platforms  the society states to date  there is no scientific evidence to validate the unfounded misinformation  allowing such misstatements to propagate may impact many vulnerable individuals awaiting anaesthesia for surgical procedures and their inclination for vaccinationÂ  the statement goes on to say that if the surgery is an emergency  recent vaccination should not be the reason to defer surgery full press statement is seen below  msa net   archived american society of anesthesiologistsÂ  asa  had shared similar views stating that while there is no evidence that either covid    or the vaccine interferes with anesthesia it is advisable to wait until you are fully recovered from covid   or fully immunized after vaccination before proceeding with surgery  the reason being surgery is stressful process on the body and temporarily puts extra strain on the immune system  asa states if youve been vaccinated  your surgery should be scheduled at least two weeks after your final dose so that you are fully protected in case of non emergency surgeries  asa   archived cdc recommends that if you have recently had surgery  been hospitalized  or had procedure that required anesthesia  or if you have any of these events coming up  talk to your doctor about getting covid    vaccine  your doctor will help you decide when to be vaccinated to make sure the benefits of vaccination outweigh potential risks also read  conclusionÂ  from our investigation  it is clear that while there is no scientific basis in the viral claim  anesthesiologists have advised to wait for few days after getting vaccinated  in case of non emergency surgeries Â  that is mainly for the person to be fully immunized after vaccination procedure and to ensure that there would not be any extra strain on the immune system from vaccination  however  if the surgery is an emergency  recent vaccination should not be the reason to defer surgery as per the information available so far  there is no warning to by the vaccine manufacturers or by who requesting vaccinated individuals to avoid anesthesia and there is no evidence so far which suggests that taking any form of anesthetic measures post vaccination is life threatening  title is it life threatening to use anesthetics after getting vaccinated for covid     result  misleading,[0. 0. 1. 0.

isolation  and quarantine remain the best options available to maintain healthy environment for our cadets and west point community  as the academy has transitioned from the academic program to summer military training activities  accommodations and risk mitigation measures are being made to protect all cadets within these policies and established guidelines  the health and welfare of the corps of cadets remains our top priority as we ensure that our mission critical task to maintain readiness continues  currently  the department of defense is not mandating vaccinations for u s  military

drugs administration on the use of bovine derived materials in vaccine   although synthetic media have been developed for growth of many medically important microorganisms  some still require additional nutrients which are easily provided by animal derived products such as serum and blood  viral vaccines are produced in living cells  which  similarly  require the addition of complex growth media components  such as fetal calf serum   we reached out to virologist dr jacob t john  who also said that the use of calf serum was common practice in virology  covaxin  the india made vaccine

is developed using whole virion inactivated vero cells derived platform technology  to produce the vaccine  vero ccl    cells are grown in the lab  for the cells to grow outside the body  they need conditions that will allow them to divide and turn into specific cell types required for the production of the vaccine  in case of covaxin  dulbeccos modified eagle medium  dmem   combined with

stabilisers to produce the final product  according to the fact sheet provided by bharat biotech  the covaxin vaccine is made up of   g of whole virion inactivated sars cov   antigen  strain  niv            and the other inactive ingredients such as aluminum hydroxide gel  tlr     agonist  imidazoquinolinone  tm   phenoxyethanol  and phosphate buffer saline  contrary to what several social media users  including pandhi claimed  the information on the use of nbcs has been in public domain since september       when icmr and bharat biotech released preclinical study on covaxin  foetal bovine serum  fsb  was widely used to produce vaccine previously  however  due to ethical concerns  scientists shifted to using ncbs  claims that covaxin and covishield uses fbs were shared widely last years  which was debunked by fit here  the claim on slaughtering of calves for deriving calf serum is partially true  both fetal serum and nbcs are by products of cattle industry and hence easily available from countries like the usa  new zealand and australia where extensive cattle farming is carried out  india also imports cattle serum in huge quantities every year  however  dr john explained that the calves don t have to be slaughtered to derive the serum  the serum is derived from the new born calf before it starts drinking milk from its mother  that ensures that no anti bodies are present in the serum which could hamper the vaccine production process  the calves can then be reared if the farmers choose to do that  however  male calves are not of much use to the farmers and they choose to slaughter them after the extraction of the serum  other methods of providing nutrition to the cells artificially  thus replacing cattle serum  are also present but they are expensive and required specialised labratories  after claims about the use of ncbs went viral  both the ministry of health and bharat biotech issued clarifications on how it is used   newborn calf serum is used only for preparation  growth of vero cells  these vero cells  after the growth  are washed with water  with chemicals  also technically known as buffer   many times to make it free from the newborn calf serum   read the press note issued by the ministry of health and family welfare   the final vaccine  covaxin  does not contain newborn calf serum at all and the calf serum is not an ingredient of the final vaccine product   the press note added  bharat biotech in statement to the press said   new born calf serum is used in the manufacturing of viral vaccines  it is used for the growth of cells  but neither used in growth of sars cov  virus nor in the final formulation   evidently  misleading claims about the use of cattle serum in covaxin covid    vaccine were shared to create false narrative and spread vaccine hesitancy   not convinced of post or information,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

these rare adverse events  see how safe are the vaccines  link to this early in the rollout of covid    vaccines in the u s   we addressed questions and claims about the impact of vaccination on fertility  some claims used bogus argument to conclude that the mrna vaccines  from pfizer biontech and moderna  would cause female sterilization  in reality  the centers for disease control and prevention notes that there is no evidence any vaccine  including those for covid     cause fertility problems  more recently  some posts swirling on social media have spread an unfounded narrative that the vaccines will create widespread infertility problems for men   may    story published on website called the daily expose  based in the u k   and shared on facebook more than       times  claims that the vaccines could cause mass male infertility   the story cites an interview with roger hodkinson  canadian pathologist who in      reportedly called covid    the biggest hoax  erroneously likening the disease to the flu  it claims that the spike protein expresses in the placenta and the testes  which could kill unborn babies in current pregnancies and permanently stop men having children  the daily expose story also takes aim at dr  anthony fauci  suggesting the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases is dead man walking  the claims have been republished on other websites and spread elsewhere  including on twitter and instagram  where one popular post declared that all males who have been vaccinated are effectively sterile  but experts say there is no evidence that the vaccines cause infertility in men  and there are new data that further undercut the online claims  in studyÂ published june    in the journal of the american medical association  researchers at the university of miami reported that they found no significant decreases in any sperm parameter among group of healthy men before and after receipt of covid    vaccine  the team collected semen samples of    men     and older  before receiving either the pfizer biontech or moderna vaccine  and again more than    days after receiving their second dose  this is the full life cycle of sperm and    days is sufficient time to see if the vaccine impacts semen parameters  daniel c  gonzalez  medical student at the university and one of the studys authors  said in statement  we measured semen volume  sperm concentration  and the total amount of moving sperm and found there were no declines in any of the parameters as compared to the baseline analysis  researchers at hospital in israel have reported similar findings in study that has not yet been peer reviewed  that study evaluated the sperm production in    men before and after receiving the pfizer biontech vaccine  our results demonstrate that the vaccine does not impair sperm parameters  the authors wrote  dr  puneet masson  director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at penn medicine  also told us in phone interview that his observations in the field rebut the notion that vaccines are detrimental to male fertility  ive had patients who had fertility testing pre vaccine and post vaccine  just by virtue of my practice  and i have not had any patients i can think of who have had any adverse reactions from the vaccines in terms of fertility  he said  the society for male reproduction and urology and the society for the study of male reproduction issued joint statement in january saying that covid    vaccines should be offered to men desiring fertility  similar to men not desiring fertility  when they meet criteria for vaccination  the statement notes that some men could experience fever following vaccination  which can cause temporary declines in sperm production  thus  if man experiences fever as the result of the covid    vaccine  he may experience temporary decline in sperm production  but that would be similar to or less than if the individual experienced fever from developing covid    or for other reasons  the statement said  masson said that someone getting mild fever from vaccine is still better than getting covid     especially since fever from the disease may last longer  experts say fever could affect mans fertility for upward of three months  but again  thats any fever  not something unique to fever following vaccination  hodkinson  the canadian pathologist cited in the daily expose story alleging the potential for mass male infertility  made similar suggestions in may video interview  he claimed that the ace  receptor is present in the testes and its actually on the cells that produce spermatozoa  on the screen of the video  the headline of paper reads  ace  receptor expression in testes  implications in coronavirus disease      pathogenesis  that paper was published in      in the journal biology of reproduction  the study dealt with the covid    disease  not the vaccines  two of the studys authors told us in an email that there was  bsolutely not anything in their paper that suggests the vaccines could cause issues with the testes or male fertility  the paper is hypothetical article about the potential effect of sars cov   infection on male reproductive health  not about the impact of covid    vaccine on male reproductive health  said saguna verma  professor and immunologist at the university of hawaii  and dr  hooman sadri  an assistant professor and reproductive biologist at wake forest university  we hypothesized that sars cov   could infect testes cells and lead to testosterone reduction or germ cell depletion for short term period  this hypothesis was based on the clinical reports of reduced testosterone levels in covid    patients  they said  they noted that these effects were transient in patients  so their paper did not prove that infection with the virus leads to male infertility  either  on that point  the university of miami research team that studied male fertility and the covid    vaccines has previously reported evidence that three men who died from covid    had impaired sperm function  and that the virus was present in the testes of one man  prompting questions about whether the virus itself could potentially affect male fertility  the studys lead author  dr  ranjith ramasamy  suggested further studies on the issue are in order  correction  june     saguna verma is

from lemon drops and red onions to alkaline foods and high doses of vitamin c  the internet is full of alternative remedies claiming to be protective against covid     none of these quick fixes has

prevent covid    vaccine shedding   concerned with vaxx shedding  white pine tea can stop it   claimsÂ a june   instagram post Â  the poster allegesÂ a chemical compound found in the tree s needles  called suramin Â can prevent many of the supposed effects of vaccine shedding  in an accompanying infographic  such effects are listed as  inhibit ing  inappropriate replication modification of genetic material  stop ping  the spike protein from disrupting  the  menstrual cycleÂ and prevent ing  damage from viral  and vax shedding  Â  the post also touts the benefits of shikimic acid  saying it is  so important in surviving viral infections  Â  but white pine tea doesn t prevent vaccine shedding among people who have received the covid    shot because vaccine shedding caused by that injectionÂ isn t an actual phenomenon  experts say  and while some research has found suramin might be potentially helpful against covid    infection  it doesn t come from pine needles Â and both it andÂ shikimic acid may actually be more harmful than beneficial Â  fact check  fauci is not making millions from upcoming national geographic book usa today has reached out to the instagram user for comment Â Â  vaccine shedding can rarely occur with someÂ types of vaccines  but not with the ones currently available for covid      as noneÂ of the current covid    vaccines authorized for emergency use in the usa contain live sars cov   virus  viral shedding is not an issue for these vaccines  Â dr  matthew laurens  an infectious disease specialist and vaccine researcher at the university of maryland school of medicine  said in an email to usa today  live attenuated vaccines  or lavs  refer to shots that contain weakened version of the virus stripped of its ability to replicate  this form prevents it from stirring up serious disease and infection while still provoking strong immune response Â lavs include those for smallpox  chickenpox and the combined vaccine for measles  mumpsÂ and rubella Â Â Â Â Â  the johnson   johnson covid    vaccine does use common cold virus to carry and deliver the genetic instructions for the covid    spike protein to cells  technology known as viral vector   but again  the virus is unable to make copies of itself to causeÂ disease Â said john grabenstein of the immunization action coalition and former director of the defense department s immunization program Â Â Â Â Â Â  similarly  the spike protein encoded by the messenger rna  or mrna  of the pfizer and moderna vaccines  can t be transmitted from one vaccinated person to another unvaccinated person  the mrna vaccines make the spike protein for few hours and then stop  they don t ever get outside the body   grabenstein told usa today Â  the post s claim that white pine tea can stop  inappropriate replication modification of genetic material  also has no basis in science  mrna can t be incorporated into human dna because it doesn t enter the nucleus  the cell s genetic powerhouse Â  grabenstein explained that if the cell were chicken egg  the nucleus would be the yolkÂ and the cytoplasm  the area outside of the nucleus where other cellular structures like the mitochondria are found  would be the white of the egg  the mrna strictly works in this  white  region and is degraded there once the cell produces the spike protein  there is still small chance vaccinated people can get sick and spread the virus  called vaccine breakthrough cases Â but this is expected since the vaccines don t confer      protection  and research suggests these individuals are less likely to transmit covid    compared withÂ unvaccinated people  this spread isn t related to any kind of vaccine shedding  it s just natural disease spread as happens far more often between the unvaccinated  fact check  pennsylvania s mask mandate not over until june    there isÂ some evidence to suggest the covid    infection itself  not being around people purportedly  shedding  the vaccine  can impact menstruation  thus good reason for women to get vaccinated   claims tying vaccine shedding to changes in one s period or miscarriages have been previously debunked by usa today

Â or from replicating Â  fact check  covid    vaccines don t produce dangerous toxins  the common and considerably toxic side effects of suramin and the lack of consistent  promising results from laboratory studies likely explain why suramin is not currently used to treat or prevent covid      laurens said Â  shikimic acid is key ingredient in making influenza drug tamiflu and can come from

pathway mentioned in the post asÂ  important in surviving viral infections  is used by bacteria  fungi  some plants and algae to create basic amino acids  this pathway isn t present in humansÂ since

social media post claims the efficacy rates of four covid    vaccines are far lower than those claimed by vaccine companies  citing figures from peer reviewed study as evidence  the may    facebook post features screenshot that says lancet study confirms vaccine efficacy is not the    per cent stated by the vaccine companies  it goes on to claim the actual efficacy rates are between      per cent and     per cent for various vaccines  adding  they deceived everyone by reporting relative risk reduction  rrr  rather than absolute risk reduction  arr   the post was from facebook account for australian jamie mcintyre  who has previously shared misinformation regarding covid    and vaccines  similar claims have also been shared by social media accounts in canada and the uk  claims that vaccine efficacy rates are much lower than commonly cited figures misinterpret the lancet article  which is commentary piece not peer reviewed study  that has been used to support the suggestion  the article does not say that covid    vaccines are ineffective nor that their publicly quoted efficacy rates are wrong  only that multiple measures of efficacy should be used to properly determine the benefits of vaccine  the lancet microbe article  written by academics in the uk and luxembourg  argues that absolute risk reduction  arr  figures should be cited alongside relative risk reduction  rrr  rates when vaccine trial results are outlined in order to avoid reporting bias and to ensure public health decisions around which vaccines to deploy are based on full picture of the data  vaccine efficacy is commonly reported in only rrr terms following clinical trials  the figures listed in the facebook post are the arr rates included in the article for four vaccines commonly used in western countries  however  contrary to the posts suggestion that the arr rates show vaccines true efficacy  the different rates do not contradict each other or show that the vaccines are largely ineffective  rather  rrr shows the reduction in risk of an outcome based on an intervention  in this case  the reduced chance of contracting covid    after being inoculated against the virus  in comparison  as explained by meedan health desk experts  arr is simply the difference in infection rates between the intervention group and the placebo group  paul glasziou  the director of the institute for evidence based healthcare at bond university  gave hypothetical example of the difference between the two measures  over the next year patient had two per cent chance  but by performing treatment that risk was reduced to one per cent  thats    per cent relative reduction  rrr   in other words youre halving the number of people who would get an event out of those who would get it  he told aap factcheck  but its an absolute one per cent reduction because youve gone from two per cent to one per cent  piero olliaro  co author of the lancet article and professor of poverty related infectious diseases at the university of oxford  told aap factcheck in an email the article did not suggest that vaccines did not work  it is extremely disappointing to see how information can be twisted and how divisive discussions have become especially on covid    vaccines these vaccines are good public health interventions  he said  associate professor james wood  an expert in mathematical modelling and infectious diseases epidemiology at unsw sydney  said there are limitations with using arr to measure persons risk of getting covid     the basic problem with this idea is that it assumes that the absolute risk observed in the trial is good measure of your risk of getting covid without the vaccine  its not  trials are of limited duration  only few months   and we expect that without vaccine pretty much everyone will eventually be exposed to covid  dr wood said in an email  using arr would be highly misleading about eventual risks of contracting covid    in the absence of vaccination  and vastly underestimates the benefits of the vaccines  as noted in the lancet article  arr figures are influenced by background factors such as the infection rate within given population  dr glasziou noted the time frame in which data was collected also affected arr rates  while rrr figures generally remained steady  vaccine efficacy rates shown in clinical trials have since been backed up by data from various international rollouts  us analysis showed the pfizer and moderna vaccines were at least    per cent effective in preventing infection in real world settings  while another set of data from israel put the pfizer vaccines effectiveness at stopping infection at    per cent  further data  yet to be peer reviewed  suggests the astrazeneca vaccine  page    offers similar level of protection from symptomatic illness  similar claims have been debunked by other fact checking organisations here  here and here  the post misrepresents the lancet article  which is commentary piece and not peer reviewed study as claimed  the article does not say covid    vaccines are ineffective or that their widely cited efficacy rates are wrong  only that multiple measures should be used to assess vaccines overall effectiveness  pharmaceutical companies have not deceived people as to vaccines effectiveness as the measures referred to in the study represent the same information in two different ways that are not contradictory  real world data suggests covid    vaccines are highly effective in reducing the risk of infection or illness  false  content that has no basis in fact,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
asymptomatic covid    doesnt exist  not only does it exist but significant evidence shows it accounted for huge numbers of positive cases and is transmissible  covid    is deliberate hoax designed to promote the climate change agenda  this is misinterpretation of book written in      by the executive chairman of the world economic forum  vaccine manufacturers have never claimed their vaccines stop transmission of covid     this is not true and theres plenty of evidence to show how the vaccines do considerably reduce transmission  the available covid    vaccines are type of gene therapy  this is not true  none of the vaccines change genetic code or attempt to replace genes  video interview of conspiracy theorist david icke  posted on facebook  makes number of misleading and dangerous claims about covid    vaccine manufacturers  gene therapy and asymptomatic cases of the virus Â  during the video  mr icke claims the transmission of covid    through those with asymptomatic cases of the virus is hoax and brands asymptomatic covid    load of nonsense  there is large amount of evidence that asymptomatic cases not only exist but may have accounted for huge proportion of total covid    cases  one analysis published in the lancet in january states that asymptomatic covid    patients are infectious  although may be less so than symptomatic patients   it concluded that where resources permit  contact tracing should proactively seek people with asymptomatic covid    because they can transmit disease and will need to be contained if national policy objective is to minimise cases and transmission  other analysis has been more forthright  meta analysis of eight chinese studies  published in the journal of the american medicine association  says that transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated in some cases to have accounted for more than half of all covid    transmissions  mr icke also claims that klaus schwab  founder and executive chairman of the world economic forum said covid    was an opportunity for great reset to save the world from human caused climate change and later states that covid    and climate change are two hoaxes perpetuated by the same force Â  the basis for this  he says  was book by mr schwab and author theirry mallaret called the great reset  since its publication in      it has drawn the attention of conspiracy theorists Â  the great reset  very broadly summarised  discusses how the worlds political  business and social institutions may wish to address pre existing geo political concerns  such as global warming  in the aftermath of the covid    pandemic Â  in the book mr schwab suggests the possibility of creating long lasting and wider environmental changes through changes in behaviours and new activism as society readapts to world in which it must co exist with covid     he also provides some evidence of some of the efforts being made by big business and others to achieve this Â  however  mr schwab also states the pandemic has created significant risk that the climate change agenda could be deprioritised as nations attempt to deal with other pressures caused by the virus Â  mr schwab states that some economies may even put aside concerns about global warming to concentrate on their recovery following covid     which may well include subsidising fossil fuel heavy and carbon emitting industries Â  so while mr schwab did talk about climate change policy and action in respect of the global recovery from covid     there is nothing to suggest the pandemic was engineered to promote this agenda  mr icke also suggests that none of the manufacturers of covid    vaccines are claiming to stop transmission  evidence shows vaccines reduce the risk of infection for those who have been vaccinated  and the risk of people who have been vaccinated from passing on the virus Â  while manufacturers of covid    vaccines have not claimed they prevent      of transmission  as they do not  evidence suggests the vaccines significantly reduce the risk  evidence from public health england showed that the vaccine reduces the risk of infection by more than     which rises to     after two weeks Â  other studies have shown recipients of the pfizer vaccine were     less likely to contract covid     for the moderna vaccine that was     and for astrazeneca it was     Â  initial research  covering over million contacts in the uk  has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between     and     less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts  this protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination  and was regardless of age  we also have repeatedly written about the links between transmission of covid    and vaccines  mr icke says plainly at one point that none of the covid    vaccines fulfill the definition of vaccine but that they are gene therapy  gene therapy is technique to treat illnesses by modifying an individuals  genes  for example by replacing faulty gene with healthy one  as we have stated before  some of the covid    vaccines contain messenger rna  mrna  that codes protein specific to pathogens surface  this mrna provides instructions to make the proteins usually found on the surface of the covid    virus  this in turn prompts the body to make covid    antibodies Â  however  introduction of mrna into human cells does not change the dna of the human cells and if these cells replicate  the mrna would not be incorporated into the new cells genetic information  there are number of other claims within the video which weve already debunked including false claims that that the inventor of pcr said it couldnt be used to detect infectious diseases  that vaccines make you infertile and that the current covid    vaccines dont fulfil the definition of what vaccine is  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because asymptomatic covid    does exist  covid    is not hoax to force climate change policy  vaccines do reduce the transmission of covid    and covid    vaccines do not work in the same way as gene therapy,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

subsequent ccdh report  but despite this  tenpenny was invited by ohios republican lawmakers to testify in favor of bill that would prohibit mandatory vaccinations or vaccination status disclosure  during that june         hearing  she relayed false information about covid    inoculations and  g  and what she said were the vaccines magnetic properties  her earlier appearance on the youtube video continues to spread online  afp breaks down the list of claims she made  tenpenny starts the video by claiming that there is transmission  that we believe is the spike protein that has been created by these injections into people  its being transmitted to other people without close personal contact Â this causes health issues including abnormal bleeding and blood clots  among vaccinated people as well as those who have not been inoculated  she said  mrna vaccines  the most widely used in the us  differ from previously offered inoculations in that instead of confronting the immune system with part of virus in weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies  they give it blueprint of part of the virus  the spike protein  that the body can then recognize and fight when confronted by it later   drew weissman  professor of medicine and mrna researcher at the university of pennsylvanias perelman school of medicine  dismissed the notion of spike protein transmission  he told afp on june           the spike protein made by the vaccine cannot be transmitted to another  it is utterly impossible  the protein is found in lymphoid organs and at very small levels in the circulation  there is no way for this protein to be released  in previous fact check published in april       dasantila golemi kotra  microbiologist at york university  explained to afp that no spike protein gets shed during inoculation and it cannot infect someone else Â  she said  if it is digested it will be destroyed by the low ph in our stomach and the enzymes there  and if it gets stuck in the skin or enters the mouth or the eyes or nose  it is very likely to be digested by the enzymes secreted by our cells on these environments  on its website  the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  explains that once the instructions  mrna  are inside the immune cells  the cells use them to make the protein piece  after the protein piece is made  the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them  in the video  tenpenny claims that thousands of people have been killed by these shots  and calls the coronavirus vaccines deadly weapons  in five months  it has killed more than       people that we know of thats an fda database number  monitored by the fda  collected by the cdc  those are government numbers  she said  this is reference to the vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers   run by the cdc and food and drug administration  vaers has been the subject of recurrent online misinformation  as seen on the cdcs webpage  the number mentioned by tenpenny is of deaths following vaccination  not fatalities proven to be caused by vaccine  review of available clinical information  including death certificates  autopsy  and medical records has not established causal link to covid    vaccines  the cdc says on its page  however  it adds that recent reports indicate plausible causal relationship between the j j janssen covid    vaccine and rare and serious adverse event    blood clots with low platelets    which has caused deaths  administration of the single dose johnson   johnson vaccine  which uses technology different from the mrna shots  was paused due to the rare blood clot issue  but subsequently resumed following recommendation by the cdc and fda  susan ellenberg  professor of biostatistics  medical ethics and health policy at the university of pennsylvanias perelman school of medicine explains that the vaers deaths reports represent only events that happened after vaccination  without any evidence of causal effect  vaccines are designed to prevent one thing  they wont prevent any bad thing that might happen to someone  she also told afp on june     tenpenny says  i talked to physician last night who works in an urgent care  and she said shes getting    to    men per week coming into her urgent care talking about testicular swelling and lack of being able to maintain an erection after getting their shots  afp fact check has previously addressed infertility claims  here Â  on june     taison bell  critical care and infectious disease physician at the university of virginia  said by phone  this connection with male fertility is just not true in the long term  i have seen couple of studies showing that if man has high fever associated with the vaccine  there can be temporary drop of sperm count but that comes right back  joint statement on the american society for reproductive medicine  asrm  website makes similar observation  fevers can cause temporary declines in sperm production  thus  if man experiences fever as the result of the covid    vaccine  he may experience temporary decline in sperm production  but that would be similar to or less than if the individual experienced fever from developing covid    or for other reasons  in the us  more than     million covid    shots have been administered  although the rate of new infections is declining  misinformation about vaccines continues to spread  threatening

source  kelly victory  twitter     jun       Â      review   the ongoing covid    vaccination campaigns in many countries have been accompanied by close attention from health authorities to monitor vaccine safety  indeed  thanks to monitoring by regulatory agencies  researchers have been able to detect and investigate even very rare events  such as blood clotting disorders now associated with viral vector covid    vaccines  discussed in this health feedback review  in april       israel  which launched the fastest covid    vaccination campaign in the world thus far  reported tens of cases of myocarditis among more than five million people who were vaccinated  myocarditis is condition in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed  the condition can vary significantly in terms of severity  some have myocarditis without realizing it  while others require medical care  researchers have identified several causes of myocarditis  such as viral infections  autoimmunity  and certain medications  in developed countries like the u s   among known causes  viral infections are the leading cause of myocarditis  most recover and go on to lead full lives  although some cases require treatment or even heart transplant  study published in      reported that fewer than    of myocarditis patients required heart transplant  while estimates from earlier studies ranged between   to        in may  both the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  and the european medicines agency reported that they were reviewing cases of heart inflammation as well  reuters later reported in early june that israeli health authorities thought that there was probable link between heart inflammation and the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  the most widely used vaccine in the country  these cases also more often occurred in males and after the second dose of the vaccine  because the data so far indicates that the majority of these cases occur in young people aged    and below  and because the covid    mortality rate for this age group is low relative to older populations  some questioned whether covid    vaccination in adolescents and young adults would be worth the risk of heart inflammation  one example can be seen in physician kelly victorys tweet  which was shared by the facebook page earthley  which sells all natural products  another example is seen in this facebook post by radio show host wendy bell  bell  victory  and the facebook page earthley all previously shared misinformation about covid     this review aims to provide perspective on this issue by discussing myocarditis among vaccinated people and covid    patients  and explain why vaccination would be less risky compared to getting covid     in her tweet  victory claimed that only      of all covid    vaccines have been given to people between the ages of    and     yet       of cases of vaccine induced myocarditis and pericarditis have been in that age group  recall  this same age group has covid    recovery rate of         she didnt cite her source for the figures in her tweet  but the numbers are identical to those presented by the cdc covid    vaccine task force on    june       specifically from the one shown below  these deal with preliminary cases of heart inflammation after two doses of rna vaccines reported to vaers up until    may        because cases of heart inflammation have been occurring in people even before the covid    vaccines became available  it is necessary to compare the rate of heart inflammation cases in vaccinated people with the baseline rate in the population  as shown above  the incidence of heart inflammation in those who received the rna vaccines was higher than expected in people aged between    to    years old  but not for other age groups  as the slide above shows  victorys figures are mostly accurate  although it is unclear where she derived the figure of covid    recovery rate of        nor did she define recovery rate  her claim that these cases are vaccine induced is also unsupported by the evidence for the moment  vaers reports only show that an adverse event occurred after vaccination  they arent evidence that the vaccine caused the adverse event  at the moment  scientists are still investigating whether there is causal association between the rna vaccines and heart inflammation  although they are investigating possible link  in the same presentation by the cdc covid    vaccine task force  there are also lot of other data demonstrating the safety of rna vaccines in youth that victory left out  leaving readers with an incomplete and potentially misleading message about the vaccines safety  for instance  victory didnt mention that of     case reports of myocarditis and pericarditis      had been discharged  of which     went home  and among the     discharged      fully recovered from symptoms      had ongoing illness or unknown status  therefore  based on what we know so far  the majority of heart inflammation cases recovered fully  the u s  cdc website also states that most patients who received care responded well to medicine and rest and quickly felt better  however  caveat about these case reports is that the cdc is still reviewing more cases  and the final results may change our current outlook on the vaccines  the presentation also showed that of more than       adverse events reported to the u s  vaccine adverse events reporting system after receipt of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine in    to    year olds  more than     were non serious  with dizziness and nausea among the most common side effects  note that more than     million vaccine doses had been administered to people in this age group   its true that adolescents and young adults are less likely to die compared to older age groups  data as of   june      show that of more than         deaths involving covid    in the u s       occurred among those aged between   to    years old and more than       among those aged between    to    years old  according to the cdcs provisional death counts   indeed  claims suggesting that covid    is trivial commonly emphasize its relatively low mortality rate  particularly in the youth  this false dilemma masks the fact that there are more outcomes to covid    besides complete recovery and death  while the cdc report found that rna vaccines are associated with higher than expected incidence of heart inflammation in those aged between    to    years  it is important to remember that covid    itself can cause heart inflammation as well  in addition to other health complications  for instance  multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children  or mis c for short  is condition that results in inflammation of multiple organs  such as the heart  lungs  kidney  and brain  most cases of mis c appear to be linked to history of sars cov   infection  according to the cdc      of cases tested positive for sars cov    while    had contact with someone with covid     to date  there have been more than       cases of mis c and    deaths related to mis c  in addition  children are also prone to developing long covid like adults are  the cdc defines long covid as range of symptoms that can last weeks or months after first being infected with the virus that causes covid    or can appear weeks after infection  long covid can happen to anyone who has had covid     even if the illness was mild  or they had no symptoms  the condition leads to symptoms that run the gamut from headaches  loss of smell or taste  fatigue  shortness of breath  and cognitive deficits  how often long covid develops in children is unclear as there isnt much data  although the u k  office of national statistics estimated that between    to     of children with covid    have symptoms lasting more than five weeks  long covid can have detrimental effect on persons quality of life  in report by stat news on long covid in children  audrey john

were not going to learn for long time  the cdc continues to recommend that everyone aged    years and older get the covid    vaccines  given the greater risk of other serious complications related to

organization that called for the cessation of covid vaccine use  the organization  called the evidence based medicine consultancy ltd  used data from the u k s yellow card system  which records adverse events reported after receiving vaccine dose  the yellow card scheme  similar to the vaccine adverse events reporting system in the u s   can be added to by anyone  whether clinician or member

the figures reported through the scheme are not sufficient to establish proven side effect  the u k s medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra   which runs the yellow card scheme

coincidence that an adverse event  such as cancer diagnosis or speech disorder  happened within short period after vaccination  detailed analysis is needed to understand whether an adverse event happens at higher rate than would be expected in the population  the director of the evidence based medicine consultancy ltd  tess lawrie  wrote to the head of the mhra about the adverse events reported for the covid    vaccines  in the letter  which was quoted heavily in the article on americas frontline doctors  lawrie said that she would like to draw your attention to the high number of covid    vaccine attributed deaths  however  as previously explained  deaths or any adverse events reported through the yellow card scheme were not attributed to vaccination  in the letter  lawrie stated that she recognized the limitations of the data and understood that information on reported adverse drug reactions should not be interpreted as meaning that the medicine in question generally causes the observed effect or is unsafe to use  however  she contradicted this by concluding  the mhra now has more than enough evidence on the yellow card system to declare the covid    vaccines unsafe for use in humans  as evidence for her statements  lawrie cited the numbers of various adverse events identified through the yellow card scheme  however  these reports cant be used to establish causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of an adverse event  in addition  the raw numbers lack the context necessary to establish whether the vaccines are safe for use or not  among the factors to consider are the expected side effects from vaccination  adverse events that would have happened regardless of vaccination  and the benefits of vaccination  the figures used by lawrie overlook the fact that most of the reported adverse events are minor and transient  consisting of expected immune system responses associated with the use of vaccines  for instance  almost half of the nervous system disorders reported were headaches  which is listed as very common side effect of the vaccines  there are also many reports of other common side effects such as pain  nausea  fever  and fatigue  the mhra website clarified  for all vaccines  detailed review of all reports has found that the overwhelming majority relate to injection site reactions  sore arm for example  and generalised symptoms such as flu like illness  headache  chills  fatigue  tiredness   nausea  feeling sick   fever  dizziness  weakness  aching muscles  and rapid heartbeat  generally  these happen shortly after the vaccination and are not associated with more serious or lasting illness  these types of reaction reflect the acute immune response triggered by the body to the vaccines  are typically seen with most types of vaccine and tend to resolve within day or two  about    million people in the u k  have received at least one dose of covid    vaccine since december       among such large group of people  we would naturally expect to observe many medical conditions to arise that would have happened regardless of vaccination  the numbers reported through the yellow card scheme do not provide this context  which would be necessary to determine whether an adverse event is occurring at an increased rate  the mhra said  the total number and the nature of yellow cards reported so far is not unusual for new vaccine for which members of the public and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report any suspected adverse reaction  each drug or vaccine is expected to cause certain degree of side effects  however  this is weighed against the benefits of such an intervention to establish whether the public should use it  lawrie does not appear to consider the benefits of vaccination in reducing deaths and hospitalizations due to covid     the mhra said  the expected benefits of the vaccines in preventing covid    and serious complications associated with covid    far outweigh any currently known side effects  as with all vaccines and medicines  the safety of covid    vaccines is continuously monitored and benefits and possible risks remain under review  the yellow card scheme and its equivalents in other countries have already shown their use in identifying rare adverse events that may be linked to vaccinations  regulators investigated following reports of an extremely rare specific type of blood clot in the brain  known as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis  occurring together with low levels of platelets  thrombocytopenia   investigations found evidence for an increased risk of these rare blood clots among younger people after receiving the astrazeneca vaccine  this led to many countries changing the vaccination guidelines  preferring an alternative covid    vaccine for younger people  similarly  rare occurrences of anaphylaxis  severe allergic reaction  also led to changes in guidance and information on the choice of vaccines for susceptible individuals  in summary  the reports identified by lawrie do not indicate any unexpected side effects from the covid    vaccines  the yellow card scheme does not assign cause to medical events following vaccination  the mhra regulatory body collects this data to prompt further investigation if they have concerns  the mhra analyzed the data and confirmed that the benefit of the covid    vaccines far outweigh any currently known side effects    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

evidence is growing that covid    vaccines may worsen the disease in some recipients because antibodies developed as result of the jab can end up enhancing disease rather than protecting against infection  antibody dependant enhancement is rare but genuine risk when it comes to creating new vaccines  there is good evidence that this does not occur with the current covid    vaccines in use  from animal studies  large human trials  and real world data from people who have received the vaccine  an article on the website conservative woman has set out concerns that the covid    vaccines may worsen covid    in some vaccinated people  through process known as antibody dependant enhancement Â  antibody dependant enhancement  ade   which the article describes  is real phenomenon  and genuine consideration during the creation of any vaccine Â  but the evidence shows that this is not occurring with covid    vaccines that are currently in use Â  ade is mechanism whereby antibodies generated during previous immune response  either from getting the infection or being vaccinated against it  dont stop you getting ill again and  instead  there is an exacerbation of the immune response and worsening of the disease Â  work to fully understand how this occurs is ongoing  but it is thought to occur through two main mechanisms  either the pre existing antibodies facilitate the entry and replication of the virus in the bodys cells  or antibodies cause the immune system to overreact  ade is very rare  however some infections  like dengue fever are known to cause the phenomena Â  historically some vaccines  which are no longer used  or which can only be used in very particular circumstances  have caused ade Â  for example  respiratory syncytial virus vaccine designed in the     s  the clinical trial was stopped and it hasnt been used   measles vaccine designed in the     s  not the mmr vaccine in current use  and dengue fever vaccine introduced in       which can now only be used in children over the age of   who have already had prior infection  Â  there was also some prior evidence from lab and animal studies for the coronaviruses sars  not sars cov    which causes covid     and mers which showed that ade type reactions sometimes occurred  this was not consistent finding  but this knowledge allowed scientists to be aware of the possibility that this could potentially occur when designing the covid    vaccines  the evidence to date does not suggest that the covid    vaccines cause ade Â  professor penny ward  chair of the education and standards committee at the faculty of pharmaceutical medicine told full fact that ade is theoretical concern with vaccines and has been observed in the past with  the respiratory syncytial virus  vaccine Â  she added  following that experience  the mechanisms by which this is caused were worked out  and as result it was possible to investigate this prior to starting human clinical trials Â  in addition the  covid     vaccines were investigated in animals which were subsequently challenged with sars cov  virus  which confirmed protection against disease and no exacerbation of pathology in animals Â  lastly  the size of the phase iii trials were large enough to detect potential for antibody enhanced disease and  as we know this was not observed  indeed the precise opposite was observed with vaccine s  being highly protective for symptomatic disease and completely preventing severe disease  this has been confirmed with  real world data  following introduction of the vaccines into clinical use  the medicines and health product regulatory agency confirmed to full fact that antibody dependant enhancement was considered theoretical risk at the time of initial approval  but there is no evidence that the vaccines cause ade  the conservative woman article references paper published in december      in the international journal of clinical practice  the paper argued that covid    vaccine trial participants  and future recipients  should be made aware of the potential risk of ade  but the study doesnt suggest that this had actually occurred with covid    vaccines Â  similarly  the article points to an open letter to international health authorities and vaccine developers from number of physicians which asked questions about potential vaccine risks  including ade  again  the authors do not suggest that there is evidence that ade has or is occuring with the covid    vaccines Â Â Â  the conservative woman piece also talks about concerns over deaths after vaccinations in gibraltar  we have previously written about how there was no evidence these deaths were related to the vaccine,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

source  sanchari sinha dutta  medical news    jun       Â      review   on   june       medical news published an article titled no point vaccinating those whove had covid     the article went viral on facebook  receiving more than        interactions and        shares in one day  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  the article questioned the usefulness of vaccinating previously infected people and received boost from media outlets  such as gateway pundit  and groups opposing vaccination like childrens health defence  facebook post from u s  senator rand paul that shared the article received more than        interactions  paul had earlier stated in radio interview that he didnt plan to get vaccinated because he had natural immunity after recovering from covid     by contrast  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  recommends getting vaccinated regardless of whether you already had covid     the medical news article is based on   june      preprint  which is study not yet peer reviewed by other scientists  the authors of the study evaluated the incidence of covid    among        employees at the cleveland clinic based on their history of previous sars cov   infection and vaccination status     data from the five months following vaccination rollout at the clinic in january      were collected retrospectively  this means that the researchers used already existing information about past infections among the participants  all the vaccinated employees received either the pfizer biontech or the moderna covid    mrna vaccines  the medical news article reported that  based on the results from this preprint  individuals with previous sars cov   infection do not get additional benefits from vaccination  however  closer look at the study design and methods reveals important limitations that make this claim premature and unsupported  as we explain below  among the        employees involved in the study        had previous sars cov   infection        of them received the covid    vaccine during the study  while       remained unvaccinated  of the remaining participants who didnt have previous sars cov   infection                  received the covid    vaccine and        remained unvaccinated  during the study period  the authors detected       sars cov   infections among previously uninfected individuals        of them         in the unvaccinated group and           in the vaccinated group  the authors didnt detect reinfections among previously infected individuals  the first caveat in the study is that the authors defined sars cov   infection as positive rt pcr test result during routine testing at the clinic  however  the clinic didnt routinely test employees without symptoms  therefore  people with mild or no symptoms might have been wrongly classified as previously uninfected or gone undetected during the study  given the small number of infections observed in most of the groups  few misclassified or undetected infections might change the conclusions of the study  furthermore  people without symptoms can still transmit the virus to others  as health feedback explained in this review  posts claiming that vaccination in previously infected individuals is useless disregard the potential benefits of vaccines in preventing viral transmission within the community  second limitation is that the sample sizes of the different groups are very uneven  while the previously uninfected groups comprise more than        individuals  the previously infected groups have only about       individuals  the unequal number of participants in each group reduces the statistical power of the study and increases skewness  which can potentially make any difference between groups appear lower or higher than it actually is  in short  while the cleveland clinic study did show that previous infection protected individuals against covid     the limitations of the study dont allow us to draw conclusions about other benefits provided by vaccination  while the authors acknowledged some of these limitations  many social media posts and articles took these results out of context    june      statement by the cleveland clinic highlighted some of the limitations of the study and recommended previously infected individuals to get the vaccine  it is important to keep in mind that this study was conducted in population that was younger and healthier than the general population  in addition  we do not know how long the immune system will protect itself against reinfection after covid     it is safe to receive the covid    vaccine even if you have previously tested positive  and we recommend all those who are eligible receive it  the medical news article claimed that covid    vaccines dont provide additional benefits to previously infected individuals based on the rate of covid    symptomatic infections  however  the reinfection rate alone isnt enough to determine the level of protection and the potential benefits of vaccination in people who had previous covid    infection  for example  the authors didnt evaluate the antibody levels or b and t cell responses in the different groups     while more than     of the people infected with covid    have protective immunity for at least six months after infection       the response varies lot between different people  asymptomatic infections generally produce lower antibody levels than symptomatic ones  and over    of infected individuals dont maintain protective immunity       in these cases  previously infected individuals remain susceptible to reinfection  which is rare but can occur     in contrast  the immunity induced by covid    vaccines is more robust and less variable than that induced by natural infection  jennifer grier  assistant professor of immunology at the university of south carolina  explained in this article published by the conversation  covid   vaccines generate both antibody and t cell responses  but this is much stronger and more consistent than immunity from natural infection  one study found that four months after receiving their first dose of the moderna vaccine       of people tested had antibodies against sars cov    this is the longest period that has been studied so far  in study looking at the pfizer and moderna vaccines  antibody levels were also much higher in vaccinated people than in those who had recovered from infection  another study showed that single dose of an mrna covid    vaccine in previously infected individuals produced seven times more antibodies and six times stronger t cell response than full vaccination in people without antibodies against sars cov    the antibodies were also more efficient at neutralizing the virus  making viral transmission to others much less likely  finally  up to     of people who recovered from covid    infection have persistent health problems  even those who only had mild symptoms  this condition  called long covid  can cause difficulty breathing  cognitive deficits  joint and muscle pain that impairs the persons quality of life     recent reports suggest that covid    vaccines might relieve persistent symptoms in some of these patients  the authors of the cleveland clinic study claimed that if prior infection does not afford protection against some of the newer variants of concern  there is little reason to suppose that the currently available vaccines would either  however  this contradicts available data  although data about reinfection with different variants of the virus remains scarce  evidence suggests that natural immunity might confer limited protection  one example is the brazilian city of manaus  despite estimates suggesting that large proportion of the population had already got infected during the first wave of covid     the city suffered devastating second wave     similar situation occurred in india in april       when the country suffered an unprecedented surge in covid    cases  despite previous widespread infection  one of the hypotheses to explain these surges was the presence of new  more transmissible variants of the virus  which may have caused reinfections among the population  during the second covid    wave in manaus  the gamma variant  also called p   and first detected in brazil  was widely circulating in the region     during the surge in india  the researchers detected the alpha  b        and delta  b          variants  first identified in the u k  and india  respectively  in contrast  the more robust immune response to covid    vaccines might enhance protection against variants  even though they dont provide      protection  for example  one study in israel showed that full vaccination with the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine prevented     of infections  despite the alpha variant circulated widely in the country at that time      some studies suggest that single dose of covid    vaccines would be strong enough to enhance protection against variants in previously infected individuals         vaccine boosters specifically designed to target new variants can further improve the immune response  as cassandra berry  professor of immunology at murdoch university  explained in this article published by the conversation  while the cleveland clinic study demonstrated that previous infection can effectively prevent covid     these results dont provide evidence that covid    vaccines are useless for people who already had covid     as many social media posts and articles claimed  such claim is unsupported and lacks important context  while it is true that most people who recovered from covid    infection are more protected against the disease than those who never had covid    and didnt get the vaccine  they can still benefit from vaccination  covid    vaccines induce stronger and more consistent immune response than natural infection      which can help reduce viral transmission  enhance protection against viral variants  and boost natural immunity in those who had low immune response to the infection    coronavirus Â covid    Â sars cov   Â vaccine   published on     jun,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0.

corrections   clarifications Â this story was updated june   Â with reworded claim that provides more nuanced summary of the point made in the facebook post being fact checked here  other references were updatedÂ for clarity  this does not change our rating for this post  which remains false Â this fact check is based on the original version of facebook post  which was updated after this check published to more precisely reference some of the data involved Â  johnson   johnson s covid    vaccine made headlines in early april after six women developed extremely rare blood clots following vaccination Â  use of the one dose shot was paused for several weeksÂ but resumed april    after the u s  food and drug administration and the u s  centers for disease control and prevention found the vaccine was overall safe and effective  despite that  doubts about the j j vaccine  particularly in older adults  linger on social media   the clinical trial indicates that in subjects    years and older  the  j j  vaccine may be only     effective  and in subjects    years or older  the age group that comprises about     of all covid    deaths  the vaccine may be    effective   claims facebook

effective  in people    and older with severe risk factors for covid      fact check  peer reviewed studies have shown safety  efficacy of covid    vaccines pic general counsel greg glaser told usa today the numbers in the post and its accompanying table were largely based on the fda s emergency authorization memorandumÂ for j j s vaccine and pic s own compiled references  Â the numbers pic putÂ forth overstate or oversimplify data in the fda sÂ official findings  though the question of how well vaccine works is often discussed as vaccine  effectiveness   the actual term is vaccine efficacy Â a slightly different but related measure  pic used the efficacy term in its chart  but referred to  effectiveness  throughout the text accompanying the post Â  efficacy is value obtained from randomized clinical trials and represents best estimate of how well the product being tested  vaccine in this case  works in an idealized condition  saidÂ natalie dean  assistant professor of biostatistics at the university of florida Â Â  in the setting of vaccine trial  this is determined by comparing the number of disease or infectionÂ cases occurringÂ among the vaccinated group with thatÂ in theÂ unvaccinated  or placebo  group  according to the cdc  if vaccine efficacy is     this means the vaccine doesn t considerably reduce theÂ risk of disease or infection for the group who received it compared with those who received placebo  vaccine efficacy nearing or at      means it most likely does Â  effectiveness  on the other hand  gives an idea of how well drugÂ or other treatmentÂ works outside clinical trial underÂ real world settings  though it relies on similar calculation Â  fact check  no  the cdc did not release data showing   in    americans declineÂ covid    vaccine dean said it s likelyÂ vaccine effectiveness will match vaccine efficacy  but there are variety of reasons why they might not  age of the vaccine recipient  presence of underlying chronic illnesses andÂ use of medications  as well as how vaccine is stored and administered or if the targeted virus mutates Â Â  glaser said pic drew its figures from table    of the fda s eua memorandum  the table presents vaccine efficacy  or ve  as percentages observed at    and    days after vaccination  the values listed for thoseÂ    and older show j j s covid    vaccine is quite efficacious        after    days and       after    days  that s better than the numbers for the    to    age group  which were       after    days and       after     because these numbers are based on sampling of the general population  about        participants across the usa  south africa and latin america        and       represent only estimates of vaccine efficacy  specifically what is called point estimate  said dr  angela branche  co director of the vaccine and treatment evaluation unit at the university of rochester medical center Â  point estimates are typically accompanied by range of values called confidence interval Â which is where pic gets its       effectiveness  the     confidence interval reported by j j means there is     likelihood the actual valueÂ is     to      pic references only the low end of that range and ignores the actual estimate value of       Â   what  pic  is reporting here is extremely misleading because you cannot interpret confidence intervals as efficacy  efficacy is what it is  it s point estimate   branche told usa today Â  confidence intervals only express the precision scientists are able to assign to that number but aren t used to represent vaccine efficacy  said dr  matthew laurens  an infectious disease specialist and vaccine researcher at the university of maryland school of medicine Â  laurens said the range of the confidence interval is product of how many people are enrolled in the study   if you look at the confidence interval for the    to     it sÂ much tighter because the numbers  ofÂ participants within that age group  are much higher  the more people we include  the more precision we have with the vaccine efficacy   he said  despite there being not as many older participants as younger ones  laurensÂ said what was especially telling aboutÂ j j s vaccine is that it performed wellÂ against covid    variants Â   of the three vaccines that have received emergency authorization in the united states   j j s vaccine  is the only one that has been tested in clinical trials in south africa  and brazil    he said   those variants were tested by this vaccine  still protected and still showed efficacy no matter the region whether it was north america  southern africa or latin america  Â Â  fact check  fauci didn t say half of cdc  fda employees refused covid    vaccine this consistencyÂ across geographies  age and race is far more crucial and spoke to the fact j j s vaccine efficacy resided in the upper     range than the lower bounds of confidence interval  laurens emphasized Â  pic s claim that j j s covid    vaccine  may be    effective  for people    and older also mishandles the fda data  table    shows that at the    day endpoint  ve is listed pretty high atÂ        ve at the    day endpoint is left blank on the chart  pic refers to this as indicating it may be    effective  but the opposite is true  branche said   efficacy only goes up as you move forward in time   she said   you re least likely to be protected early on in that    day period  as you move off toward    days and so forth  then you really have your best protection at that point   the ve was probably left blank at the    day point because j j s trial didn t have enough time to collect all the data as the fda s emergency use authorization was underway  branche said  the efficacy for that period could only be higher than the    day level  which is estimated at        it couldn t be as low as     as the post claims  lower ve estimate was observed for those   Â and older with preexisting conditions  particularly at the    day endpoint      versus       reason for this could be  imprecision owing to fewer cases and shorter follow up in this subgroup  Â a spokesperson for janssen  pharmaceutical company owned by j j  said in an email to usa today Â Â   furthermore  kaplan meier curves  statistical tool for estimating when there s incomplete data Â indicated that the cumulative incidence of cases among vaccine recipients    years of age or older with coexisting conditions was similar to that in the overall trial population  which suggests similar vaccine efficacy   the company said Â  the fda s eua memorandum supported this point  it said no covid    deaths or cases requiring medical intervention took place    days or more after vaccination among that high risk subgroup  based on our research  we rate false theÂ claim that data shows the j j covid    vaccineÂ may not be effective in older adults Â the statistics provided by physicians for informed consent in its post and accompanying table were taken from the fda s emergency use authorization for j j s vaccine but are misrepresented  the     figure isÂ the lower bound of confidence interval for vaccine efficacy    days post vaccination in the    and older age group  itÂ doesn t represent the actual efficacy Â confidence intervals are meant to give information about the precision ofÂ a value such as vaccine efficacy  not to represent vaccine efficacy itself Â the claim the vaccine could be     effective  among those    and older is wrong  experts say the    day figure can t be lower than the    day figure  which the report estimates at       Â Â althoughÂ vaccine efficacy was lower forÂ those   Â and older with preexisting conditions Â that s because there were fewer covid    cases and shorter follow ups in this group  no covid    related deaths or cases requiring medical intervention were observed in these individuals  according to the fda,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
in explaining the governments directive to keep using face masks and face shields to help control the transmission and spread of the coronavirus disease       covid      palace spokesperson harry

a poster from the mhra makes various claims about the vaccines and importance of yellow card reports  this poster is not actually from the mhra  yellow card data will allow the vaccines to move out of the phase   clinical trials and be granted full approval  yellow card data isnt required for the vaccines to move out of phase   trials  phase   trials for the vaccines have reported their main findings  and participants will be followed up for several years  the vaccines only have temporary approval by the mhra  this is essentially correct  the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines have received temporary authorisations  while the moderna and janssen vaccines have received temporary licenses which offer the possibility of being converted into permanent licenses in future  poster which has been made to look like it comes from the medical and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  has been shared on social media  and asks people to report any side effects from covid    vaccines  full fact readers have asked us whether the poster is genuine  but it is not Â Â  the poster talks about the importance of the yellow card scheme  which is the uk system for collecting reports of safety concerns such as potential side effects involving medical devices and medicines  including vaccines Â Â  it claims that yellow card reports are essential to ensure the covid    vaccines are safe and effective and will enable the vaccines to move out of phase   clinical trials and be granted full approval Â  however  these claims are not entirely true  the poster is pretty good imitation of similar graphics published by the mhra but there are still some clues which suggest that it might not be genuine  doing google image search for mhra coronavirus  covid     vaccine injury report scheme returned very similar graphics to the fake one  these images led to legitimate mhra webpage which linked to various resources for its every report counts campaign  including posters  however  none of the posters or images there matched the image were checking Â  and while the style was quite similar  using the same graphics of people and colour scheme   there were some key differences Â  the real posters use slightly different typeface and the mhras logo looks different in the fabricated poster  there is also grammatical error in the fake poster Â Â  the mhra confirmed to full fact that the image on social media did not come from them  the claims made in the fake poster are also not entirely accurate  it is true that the mhra has launched campaign promoting the yellow card scheme  and it is important people report suspected side effects from vaccines so they can be investigated  but the fake poster then says  this  data  will allow  the vaccines  to move out of the phase   clinical trials and be granted full approval by the european medical agency as it currently only has temporary approval by the mhra  this doesnt accurately represent how vaccine approval works nor the place of yellow card reports in the process Â  vaccines  like other drugs  go through number of stages before being released Â  before human trials  vaccines must be shown to be safe and effective in animals  then  phase   trials among up to     adults are focused on making sure the vaccine has no major safety concerns  and to work out the most effective dose  phase   trials involve few hundred participants and are more focused on checking the vaccine works consistently  and starting to look for any side effects  phase   trials are then conducted among  typically  thousands of participants and are used to gather statistically significant and robust data on vaccines safety and efficacy Â  following phase    the vaccine manufacturer can submit all their data to the regulatory body  which in the uk is the mhra  which will then decide whether to licence the vaccine  the four covid    vaccines approved for use in the uk  oxford astrazeneca  pfizer biontech  moderna and janssen  have all published data from their phase   trials demonstrating they are safe and effective  participants in these trials are being monitored for the next few years  but its wrong to suggest that yellow card reports are needed for the vaccines to move out of the phase   clinical trials Â  it is also wrong to suggest  as some on social media have done  that because these trials are ongoing  people who take the vaccines are themselves in clinical trials  some drugs also go through trials after being fully rolled out  known as phase   trials  which dont mean that people regularly prescribed them are in clinical trials themselves Â  analysis of the yellow card reports so far shows that  other than well known  temporary  mild and moderate side effects  such as fatigue  the risk of serious illness is very low  one possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and rare blood clot has been identified  the latest data shows around one in         people who have been given dose of the vaccine have died of one of these blood clots in the uk Â  the poster claims the vaccines have received temporary approval which is essentially correct Â  the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines have received temporary authorisation via regulation     of the human medicines regulation       while the moderna and janssen vaccines have received conditional marketing authorisation  type of licence Â  weve written about the different types of authorisation for vaccines before Â  normally  vaccines go through process to obtain marketing authorisation  also known as licence   in certain scenarios  however  for example in response to pathogenic agents  the mhra may use different types of authorisation  regulation     temporary authorisations are triggered by the government  rather than applied for by the drug company  and authorise the emergency supply of an unlicensed medicine in response to an unmet public health need  the process doesnt allow them to be turned into full permanent licenses  although that doesnt stop pfizer or astrazeneca applying for license for their vaccines in the future  conditional marketing authorisation  as held by moderna and janssen for their covid vaccines  is applied for by the company in question  it is also form of temporary authorisation  but can be converted into full  permanent marketing authorisation  or licence Â Â  the mhra has previously told full fact that temporary authorisation and conditional marketing authorisations are regulatory tools that enable medicines to be approved at the earliest time possible during an emergency situation  as soon as there are robust data to show that the benefits outweigh the risks and added that no vaccine would be authorised in this way unless the expected high standards are met

social media posts suggest people are being misled about the usefulness of covid    vaccinations because the treatments do not stop transmission of the coronavirus  former one nation candidate emma

youre being played  at the time of writing  the may    post had been shared more than     times  similar suggestions that vaccines do not stop the virus from infecting vaccine recipients or spreading have been shared widely elsewhere  one post by an australian facebook page claims many people fail to see any benefit from supposed vaccine that neither prevents the spread nor prevents infection of this virus  cartoon  shared by new zealand facebook user on may     also implies the vaccine does not provide immunity to recipients  while an instagram meme  posted by an australian user on may     suggests vaccinations will not stop people from catching covid    or passing it on to others  multiple scientific studies have concluded that covid    vaccines dramatically reduce the chance of getting infected with the coronavirus  with research also indicating they cut the risk of onward transmission  immunology experts told aap factcheck that no vaccine is     per cent effective at preventing infection or transmission  however vaccines have been highly successful to date at combating the virus  two covid    vaccines have been approved for use in australia  the pfizer biontech vaccine and the oxford astrazeneca vaccine  the pfizer vaccine has been found to be    per cent effective at reducing symptomatic covid     according to the pharmaceutical companys initial large scale clinical trial  the efficacy rate means fully vaccinated trial participants were much less likely to develop symptomatic cases of laboratory confirmed covid    when compared to unvaccinated participants who received placebo injections  the result of the pfizer trial has since been supported by real world data from israels vaccination rollout  published in the lancet on may     which found full vaccination to be      per cent effective in preventing infection with sars cov    the virus that causes covid     the figures also showed the vaccine to be      per cent effective at preventing asymptomatic infection  clinical trials of the astrazeneca vaccine in      suggested it offered lower levels of protection  with researchers finding the astrazeneca jab was      per cent effective in preventing symptomatic covid    after two doses  however  preprint study published in april by medical experts from the university of oxford found the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines offered similar levels of protection from sars cov   infection  both offered    per cent reduction in the chance of new infection  with the figure rising to    per cent for infections with strong evidence of viral shedding  jennifer juno  postdoctoral researcher at melbournes peter doherty institute for infection and immunity  told aap factcheck that no vaccine is     per cent effective at stopping infection but covid    vaccines were so far proving very successful  the currently licensed vaccines are all highly effective at preventing severe covid    disease or death  which will save many lives  dr juno said in an email  additionally  vaccines are effective at preventing people from becoming ill  symptomatic infection  or from becoming infected at all  including asymptomatic infection   which means that the vaccine not only benefits the person being vaccinated  but also those around them  the world health organization says covid    vaccines mean recipients are less likely to infect people around them  while the us centers for disease control and prevention says early data shows vaccines help prevent people with no symptoms from spreading the illness  although researchers are still learning how well the vaccines work in stopping transmission  associate professor nathan bartlett  viral immunology expert at the university of newcastles school of biomedical sciences and pharmacy  told aap factcheck the primary objective of vaccination is to protect you from severe disease  and  keep you out of hospital  thereby protecting health care systems  there are many non covid vaccines covering different types of diseases  but covid vaccines look to be amongst the most effective in terms of reducing transmission  dr bartlett said in an email  it is still possible for vaccinated people to catch covid     such as six people who recently tested positive in sydney hotel quarantine despite being vaccinated overseas and eight vaccinated members of the new york yankees baseball team who contracted the virus in may  however  cases of people contracting covid    after vaccination are both relatively rare and expected by experts  current evidence also suggests these vaccine breakthrough cases carry lower viral load than unvaccinated people who become infected  and are less likely to pass on the virus  this does mean that the vaccines do not completely      per cent  stop viral transmission  but that was unlikely to ever be the case  dr juno told aap factcheck  in an article for the conversation  university of cambridge immunologist sarah caddy said producing vaccine that entirely prevents infection and transmission  known as sterilising immunity  is often the goal of vaccine design  but this was extremely difficult to achieve  fortunately  this hasnt stopped many different vaccines substantially reducing the number of cases of virus infections in the past  dr caddy wrote  by reducing disease levels in individuals  this also reduces virus spread through populations  and this will hopefully bring the current pandemic under control  the australian government accepts that vaccination may not fully protect everyone from infection  instead  it says it aims to achieve herd immunity by immunising enough of the population to stop the disease from spreading  we seek herd immunity  health minister greg hunt told the age newspaper in january   but  that outcome will depend on the longevity of protection  the coverage of the population  expected to be high by global standards in australia   and the impact on transmission  which are yet to be determined for any vaccine  aap factcheck could find no evidence the australian government has said vaccine passports  digital verification that person has been vaccinated  would stop transmission of the virus  as claimed in the facebook post  the facebook posts suggestion that vaccines do not prevent people from becoming infected with covid    or transmitting the virus to others omits some key facts  while it is true that immunised people can still catch and spread the virus  vaccines have been shown to drastically cut infection rates and therefore reduce onward transmission  experts say no vaccine is     per cent effective in preventing infection with or transmission of virus  missing context  content that may mislead without

claim that those who receive the coronavirus disease       covid     vaccines are dangerous as they become real carrier of the virus is false  this claim was among several inaccurate statements made in an april    facebook  fb  live video that has already been viewed by over       netizens   the vaccine does not inject the virus itself  said rontgene solante  infectious disease specialist and member of the vaccine expert panel of the department of science and technology  dost  in may    interview   there are four platforms currently being used in covid    vaccines  the messenger rna  inactivated whole virus  protein subunit  and viral vectors  none of the four platforms use an active virus that can replicate inside the body  solante said   see vera files fact sheet  getting to know the covid    vaccine prospects in the philippines  the video interview was conducted with doctor named jose micabalo oclarit  former education secretary butch valdes  lawyer nick naÃ±git  and host cathy cruz on the fb page of the political party katipunan ng demokratikong pilipino  which has over        followers  such claim about the covid    vaccines has also been repeatedly debunked by health experts and fact checkers around the world  oclarit  abetted by valdes  founder and chairperson of kdp  also falsely associated the rise of covid    cases in march with the start of the countrys vaccination campaign  pinning the blame on vaccine recipients who are spreading the disease  there is no evidence  however  to prove this link  the increasing cases in march are due to several factors  including the variants  compliance with minimum public health standards  and delay in going to the doctor or getting tested when symptomatic  according to john wong  member of the technical working group on covid    variants of the inter agency task force  iatf  for the management of emerging infectious diseases  in march    press briefing  oclarit is said to be an expert in molecular biology and biochemistry  at present  he is professor of medical physiology and biochemistry at matias h  aznar memorial college of medicine at southwestern university in cebu city  in the hour and half live exchange  oclarit  valdes  and the two hosts peddled several inaccurate statements about how the jab works  all have been debunked by solante  who is also head of the adult infectious disease and tropical medicine at san lazaro hospital in manila  claim  rating  those who receive pfizer and moderna covid    vaccines can become transgenic because the mrna enters the nucleus and produces proteins that are not theirs  in the long run  this can initiate an autoimmune attack    false  the idea that viruses would evolve and grow stronger to evade vaccines may seem like common sense  but there is no evidence for these claims  according to team of health experts from global technology nonprofit meedan   the materials that make up the coronavirus vaccine are based on ribonucleic acids  rna  and  when they enter the body  they do not penetrate the nucleus at all  so they do not have chance of coming into contact with the hereditary material contained therein  said vladimir jovanovic from clinical centre of montenegro said in an april    report at the united nations childrens fund  unicef  website  therefore  we conclude that vaccination will not cause any harm to the body  especially in terms of changing the structure of the dna chain  he added  similar claims about the mrna vaccines have been made since      and disproven by several infectious disease experts  claim  rating  do not get the vaccine at the height of infection because the virus will become resistant to the vaccine and then create super dangerous strain   false   the covid    vaccines being studied and developed are expected to provide at least some protection against the new virus variants  according to the world health organization  meedan s experts also said  there is no evidence of any known vaccine causing new or more dangerous variants of covid     in fact  the more individuals remain unvaccinated  the more likely other variants are to emerge because there are more people that the covid    virus can infect  some viral mutations currently being studied are associated with immune escape or the ability to evade the immune protection provided by vaccination or previous infection   see vera files fact sheet  how the philippines is detecting new sars cov   variants  but solante said  the longer the virus stays in the community and more people will be infected  the higher is the chance that there will be more mutations and more new variants of concern  t he only way to cut this transmission is getting everybody vaccinated  claim  rating  if your body is healthy and can easily recognize the foreign body using your innate immunity  you do not need first dose or second dose  your innate immunity is enough because  it  is non specific  rapid  and complete   misleading  while innate immunity is the first defense of the body against any infection  solante said this immunity will work on particular threshold and only for short period of time  he said  what if your innate immunity could not cope up with the load of the virus that comes to your body  this is why among covid    patients  the most vulnerable sector remains the elderly  specifically people aged    years and above with comorbidities  because their innate immunity may not be that good to protect them against the covid infection  solante said  he also stressed that young individuals can still develop moderate and severe disease  because this innate immunity is not very robust or durable  solante said people need the vaccine in order to protect them  l onger and at the same time   develop  an antibody that specifically blocks the virus  these are covid specific antibodies that will really block the entry of the virus into the receptors in our cell  claim  rating  if the virus keeps mutating everyday  vaccines will no longer be effective   needs context   while there are new variants of the covid    virus emerging  most of the mutations  or changes in its genetic material  are insignificant  there are  however  variants of concern which have potential impact on transmissibility  disease severity  and vaccine and treatment efficacy  the world health organization  who  said manufacturers and the programmes using the vaccines may have to adjust to the evolution of the covid    virus  this is why as the current health crisis continues  more vaccines are expected to be developed to fill the gaps in efficacy  solante emphasized that the current vaccines against the variants are still effective despite some mutations decreasing their ability to recognize and disarm the covid    virus  that reduction is not significant so there is still adequate protection with these current vaccines and should not be cause of concern  he added  oclarit  valdes downplay covid     rehash false claims apart from the untrue statements on vaccines  the live interview with oclarit and valdes also repeated wrong statements and conspiracy theories about the

the covid    vaccines offer very little protection against the disease  this is not true  the claim is based on misinterpretation of lancet comment article  which compared different ways of measuring effectiveness  it did not refute the headline figures that have already been reported  weve seen widely shared posts on social media claiming that the covid    vaccines are less effective than people believe  based on series of figures from an article in the lancet  an instagram post shares screenshot that quotes these figures and claims that the vaccines reduce your chance of catching covid    by  pfizer       johnson   j       moderna       astrazeneca       so basically no prevention  this is false  another post on twitter claims they show that the vaccines efficacy is not as     stated by the vaccine companies  this is false too  the lancet article is comment piece  not peer reviewed research  as the posts also falsely claim  the figures quoted in the screenshot show the absolute reduction of peoples risk in percentage points  not percent  in other words they describe how much of the already low risk of getting ill with covid the vaccines took away for participants in the trials  they do not refute any of the existing evidence on how well the vaccines work  the article argues that fully understanding the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines is less straightforward than it might seem  it compares the conventional method of measuring the effectiveness of vaccine  which is by relative risk reduction  with another measurement called absolute risk reduction  relative risk reduction describes how much someones risk of somethingin this case  getting ill with covidis reduced by the vaccine  so if    unvaccinated people in group of     get ill with covid  but only one vaccinated person gets ill in similar group of      then we can say that vaccinated group have had their risk reduced from     to     which is reduction in their risk of      absolute risk reduction would describe the same situation differently  if    out of     unvaccinated people get ill with covid  then the risk of catching it in the group was      in the vaccinated group  the risk was lower  at one out of      or     this means that vaccination reduced the absolute risk of getting ill with covid by nine percentage points  that is the absolute risk reduction  the two measures therefore describe different things  the reduction in someones absolute risk depends on how much risk they were facing in the first place  whereas relative risk reduction applies no matter how much risk you might be facing  the lancet article argues that absolute risk reduction figures should be included alongside relative reduction figures when vaccine studies are reported  it reports the relative risk reductions from trials of the five covid vaccines      for the pfizerbiontech      for the modernanih      for the gamaleya      for the j j  and     for the astrazenecaoxford  it also includes what it says are the absolute risk reductions from the trials of five covid vaccines       for the astrazenecaoxford       for the modernanih       for the j j        for the gamaleya  and       for the pfizerbiontech vaccines  these are the lower numbers that were quoted in the social media posts  which use them to falsely suggest that the vaccines offer less protection than people think  in fact  these numbers show that the people who were not vaccinated in these trials had low risk of getting ill with covid  but the vaccines still took away most of that risk for the people who received them  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because the figures in the post have been misinterpreted  and the vaccines are much more effective than it claims,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

does video promising to blow the lid off covid    vaccines present only true and verified statements  no  that s not true  it makes claims about vaccine related deaths that are not proven  the video also questions why pregnant women and people who have recovered from covid    would get the vaccine  ignoring what most medical experts say about those groups  finally  it presents the vaccine as the key component of grand plan to control the populace    conspiracy theory for which there is no publicly available evidence  the doctor making the claim was listed on the staff of baylor scott   white medical center in dallas on june          but on june          baylor spokesperson said he was no longer employed there  the video  archived here  was published on rumble on may           titled  massive  world renowned doctor blows lid off of covid vaccine   it features clips from an interview with dr  peter mccullough  identified as doctor of internal medicine and board certified cardiologist  he says  at one minute     seconds  his comments can be heard below     asked if baylor stands by mccullough and his statements  the university distanced itself in june         email from media relations officer jennifer mcdowell to lead stories  writing  dr  mccullough is no longer employed with our medical group  his views are his own  and he is not speaking on behalf of baylor scott   white health  at the time of writing  on june          there have been no documented deaths due to the pfizer  moderna or j j janssen vaccines  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  says on its website  review of available clinical information  including death certificates  autopsy  and medical records has not established causal link to covid    vaccines  however  recent reports indicate plausible causal relationship between the j j janssen covid    vaccine and rare and serious adverse event  blood clots with low platelets  which has caused deaths  the cdc uses the vaccine adverse event reporting system  also known as vaers  to follow up on any report of death after vaccination  mccullough  does not specifically mention vaers in the video  but that s likely what he is referring to when he talks about the  database   at four minutes     seconds  he says  all those thousands of americans that have died with the vaccine  and hospitalizations in the database  i think are real  and they are far beyond anything we ve ever seen  what mccullough doesn t explain is that vaers is an un checked list of vaccine reaction reports to which anyone can add an item  to view the vaers site  users must click on box agreeing that they have read the caveats about vaers reports  the reports are not verified and are not sufficient evidence to establish whether death was caused by vaccine  the website for vaers makes clear the system s uses and limitations  the site reads  report to vaers generally does not prove that the identified vaccine s  caused the adverse event described  it only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after vaccine was given  no proof that the event was caused by the vaccine is required in order for vaers to accept the report  vaers accepts all reports without judging whether the event was caused by the vaccine  more than     million doses of covid    vaccines were administered in the united states between december           and may           as lead stories has reported previously  it s statistically inevitable that some people will get sick and die of unrelated causes after getting the covid    vaccine  at    minutes     seconds  mccullough questions why certain groups of people would ever get the vaccine  he says  before we know it  we re vaccinating pregnant women  why are we doing that  that can t be safe  now we re going to vaccinate covid recovered patients  wait minute  they have complete and robust permanent immunity  that s not what doctors with the relevant expertise say  the cdc recommends that people get vaccinated  regardless of whether they had covid     because it s unclear how long such people are protected  the agency says on its site  even if you have already recovered from covid     it is possible  although rare  that you could be infected with the virus that causes covid    again  the cdc also says that pregnant people can get vaccinated  although it acknowledges that there is limited safety data at this point  it notes that pregnant people are at increased risk for severe illness from covid    and that pregnant women with the disease are also at increased risk of preterm birth  compared with pregnant women without covid     mccullough does not mention any of that nuance in the clips  rather  he presents the vaccine as grand plan to create compliance and control behavior  at five minutes     seconds  he says  this is actually about marking  the vaccine is way of marking people  it s way of starting to assert efforts to create compliance  behavior control  there s no publicly available evidence to support the idea that the vaccines have purpose beyond stopping or slowing the pandemic  lead stories has written about conspiracy theories tied to the vaccine before  see here  here and here for those stories  in which we found that video does not prove that the pfizer covid    vaccine contains magnetic microchip  that the shots aren t set to contribute to the

the covid    vaccine doesnt stop you catching the disease  data shows that even one dose can significantly reduce your chances of getting infected  even without symptoms  the covid    vaccine doesnt stop you transmitting it  data has shown that even one dose can reduce the chances of you passing it to your household  the covid    vaccine is trial drug  research on the ongoing efficacy and safety of the vaccines will continue but data on key safety and efficacy aspects has been published and peer reviewed  the survival rate from covid    is        its almost certainly not as high as that in the uk  the average age of death from covid    is     this is true for deaths involving covid    registered in england and wales between october      and january       heated exchange between presenter dermot oleary and guest beverley turner on this morning  about whether the covid    vaccines stop you from catching and passing on the disease has gone viral on social media Â  ms turner claimed   the vaccine  does not stop you contracting or passing on the virus  multiple  reliable forms of evidence show that vaccines greatly reduce persons chance of contracting or passing on virus  ms turner has asked us to clarify that she meant that the vaccines dont always stop the transmission of the disease  which is correct as set out below  the nhs website says that the vaccines reduce your risk of catching  spreading  getting symptoms  getting ill  and dying from covid  and she has asked us to clarify that her remarks about transmission were intended to reflect that  studies have found that people given one dose of the pfizer vaccine have     reduced risk of becoming infected  both with and without symptoms  rising to     after the second dose  this data comes from testing healthcare workers who were tested for covid every two weeks  regardless of whether they had symptoms  data in adults over    shows that both the pfizer and the astrazeneca vaccines are between        effective against symptomatic disease around month after the first dose  and        after the second dose of pfizer  this particular study didnt look at the effect after two doses of the astrazeneca vaccine   as to ms turners claim on vaccines not stopping people passing on the virus  the evidence suggests that one dose of either the astrazeneca or pfizer vaccines significantly reduces your chances of passing on the virus to members of your household  if you do catch it  initial research  covering over million contacts in the uk  has found that people who became infected three weeks after their first vaccination were between     and     less likely to pass the virus onto household contacts  this protection appeared from around two weeks after the vaccination  and was regardless of age  this may be what ms turner was referring to when she then went on to say there was little bit of evidence to suggest that it might minimise transmission  but thats because it ameliorates your symptoms and if it ameliorates your symptoms then you are less likely to pass it on  she also made number of other claims about the covid survival rate and whether the vaccine is in trials that we have written about before  ms turner described the covid    vaccine as trial drug  while its not quite clear what this means  we have checked similar claims before  these claims have been based on the fact that some of the covid    vaccine trials have completion dates set in the future  as weve explained before  data on key safety and efficacy outcomes has already been published in peer reviewed journals  but data on long term protection and safety will continue to be collected over the coming years Â  the three coronavirus vaccines currently approved and being rolled out in the uk have been through all the normal stages of vaccine testing  including animal and human studies        survival rate from covid     the average age of death is     the survival rate is almost certainly lower than this in the uk  as weve written before Â  weve covered elsewhere howÂ  estimates for europe  countries with similar age profiles and healthcare quality as the uk  put the fatality rate at somewhere between      and     meaning the survival rate could be somewhere between     and        but not as high as        covid    is more dangerous in older populations  which is part of the reason survival rates vary between countries  as of    may there have been about         deaths registered with covid    recorded as cause on the death certificate  thats about       of the entire uk population  if the survival rate really was        and       had died  that implies that the entire population of the uk has been infected  as weve written before  this is almost certainly not the case  the figures dont show high enough rates of infection for this to be the case  its true that the average age of death involving covid    is     that was the average age of people whose deaths were registered in england and wales between october      and january      which involved covid     its been estimated that people who die of covid lose  on average  around ten years of life  update

people who were undergoing chemotherapy have been told that they should not receive vaccines  and should stay away from people who had received vaccines  and now because of covid    this has all changed  people who are immunosuppressed are advised not to have live vaccinations and not to be in close contact with people who have received certain live vaccinations  but the covid    vaccines in use in the uk are not live vaccines and people undergoing chemotherapy have been prioritised to receive them  the covid    vaccine was only tested on completely healthy people  incorrect  the trials of the covid    vaccines did include groups of people with certain medical conditions  we are also finding out more about this through post authorisation monitoring  the covid    vaccines have been authorised on an emergency licence  because they are still in clinical trials  two of the vaccines have received temporary authorisation  and the moderna vaccine has been issued conditional marketing authorisation     these classifications are regulatory tools to allow approval at the earliest time possible during an emergency situation  as soon as there is robust data to show that the benefits outweigh the risks  widely shared video on facebook makes number of claims about vaccines which are wrong or need more context Â Â  this article does not discuss all of them  but here are few of the biggest claims made in the video Â  people who are undergoing or have recently had certain treatments  such as chemotherapy  or who are immunosuppressed for other reasons  are generally advised not to have live vaccinations  or to be in close contact with people who have recently been immunised with certain live vaccinations  live vaccines contain whole bacteria or viruses which have been weakened so that they trigger an immune response without causing disease in healthy people Â  in clinically immunosuppressed people  however  there is potential risk of infection if live vaccines are used  similarly  immunosuppressed people are sometimes advised not to have close contact with other people who have recently had certain live vaccines because of risk that they may be able to spread viral particles  we have written about this process  which is sometimes colloquially known as vaccine shedding  before Â  the pfizer  astrazeneca and moderna covid    vaccines that have received authorisations in the uk so far are not live vaccines  and therefore can be given to people who have recently received chemotherapy  in fact  people who are immunosuppressed have been included in priority groups for the covid    vaccines Â Â  Â  the studies for all three of the covid    vaccines currently authorised for use in the uk included cohorts of people with underlying health conditions  as well as completely healthy people in the trials Â  approximately     of the people included in pfizers phase three trial  published in the new england journal of medicine  for example  had background comorbidity  meaning they had other medical conditions   these included wide range of medical conditions such as cancer  cardiovascular problems and diabetes Â  significant number of people given the astrazeneca vaccine in phase three trials had underlying cardiovascular disease  respiratory disease  or diabetes  the moderna trial also included people with underlying health conditions Â  based on the research  and the increased risk that covid    poses to people with certain underlying medical conditions  the world health organisation  who  has said that the covid    vaccines are safe and effective for people with conditions such as high blood pressure  diabetes and asthma amongst others  people with underlying health conditions have also been included as priority group for vaccination by the uk government Â  Â  of the three covid    vaccines that have been authorised for use in the uk  the pfizer biontech and oxford astrazeneca vaccines have temporary authorisation  sometimes known as regulation     authorisation  while the moderna vaccine has conditional marketing authorisation  all three of these vaccinesÂ   pfizer  astrazeneca and moderna  have had analysis of safety and efficacy data from phase three trials  involving tens of thousands of participants  published in peer reviewed articles in medical journals such as the lancet and the new england journal of medicine  the collection of long term protection and safety data will continue over the next couple of years  and so the completion dates for the trials are in      and      Â Â  normally  vaccines go through process called marketing authorisation  also known as licence   in certain scenarios  however  for example in response to pathogenic agents  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  may use different types of authorisation  the mhra told full fact that temporary authorisation and conditional marketing authorisations are regulatory tools that enable medicines to be approved at the earliest time possible during an emergency situation  as soon as there are robust data to show that the benefits outweigh the risks     the mhra also expanded on the differences between the two types of authorisation  it explained that regulation     or temporary authorisation is not the same as licence  instead it authorises the emergency supply of an unlicensed medicine in response to an unmet public health need  and is  triggered by the government  whereas conditional authorisation is applied for by the company Â  it also explained that conditional marketing authorisation  cma   which the moderna vaccine has  is an early  temporary licence for medicine where there is an unmet health need     cmas are reviewed on an annual basis and can be converted into full marketing authorisation but authorisations under regulation     cannot  though that doesnt mean pfizer or astrazeneca would be prevented from applying for change to the authorisations for their covid    vaccines in the future  ultimately  the mhra said  our rigorous review of the safety  quality and effectiveness of covid    vaccine candidates is the same for both routes and no vaccine would be authorised via cma or r    unless the expected high standards are met  the mhra has said that the trials for the covid    vaccines have proceeded without compromising any of the usual  high standards of scientific rigour     tens of thousands of subjects have been included in trials and all are subject to very close safety follow up over several months  this article is part of our work

weve rated this claim as partly false                 because people who are receiving chemotherapy can in general receive the covid    vaccines that are authorised at the moment  and more generally  vaccines that arent live   and the vaccine trials did include trialists with medical conditions,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

for the single dose johnson   johnson vaccine  all three were peer reviewed by multiple experts  said julia morin  spokeswoman for the nejm  in an email to usa today  all covid    research articles are published on an accelerated schedule and have the same steps as other articles  peer and statistical review  scientific and manuscript editing  the account that shared the may    post on facebook did not respond to request for comment  the u s  food and drug administration granted emergency use authorization for the pfizer and moderna vaccines in december and for the johnson   johnson shot in february  the data so far has shown the shots to be effective  particularly at preventing the most severe cases  in its clinical trial that studied more than        participants  the moderna vaccine was shown to be     effective at preventing covid     pfizers shot was     effective inÂ  trial that studied nearly        participants  those studies demonstrated the two shot vaccines are remarkably effective  said paul sax   professor of medicine at harvard medical school  in the nejm s frequently asked questions concerning the vaccine  the results are holding up in real world settings too  he wrote  including in mass vaccination program in israel and among nursing home residents  sometimes data are so strong we dont even have to do statistical analysis  thats what happened with both of these clinical trials  he wrote in answer to frequently asked questions for the journal  the results were that good  johnson   johnsons single dose vaccine was more than     effective at reducing moderate to severe covid     and it reduced the risk of severe disease by      study published in april showed  more than        participants were included in the study  the efficiency for that vaccine was lower in part because the trial took place during time when covid    cases across the u s  were much higher than during the pfizer and moderna trials Â so participants had far higher chance of being exposedÂ as they went about their daily lives  the johnson   johnson vaccine was at its most effective in reducing hospitalization  two weeks after injection  the vaccine was     effective at preventing covid    cases so severe that they required hospitalization  the study showed  four weeks after administration  it was      effective in the study group  those three trials were the touchstone studies performed on the three vaccines approve for emergency use in the u s   rachel graham  assistant professor of epidemiology at the university of north carolina chapel hill s school of global public health  toldÂ usa today  the clinical trials for the three vaccines approved for use in the u s  drew similar conclusions about their safety  side effects were mild to moderate and resolved within few days  side effects included pain at the injection site  headache  fatigue and nausea  among others  injections of the johnson   johnson vaccine stopped briefly in april to investigate whether it was causing blood clots  the clots occurred mostly among adult women younger than    years old  according to the cdc  the cdc and fda investigated the cases of blood clots in unusual locations  such as the brain and abdomen  and low platelet levels  during an    day pause on using the vaccine  in resuming use of the vaccine  the agency saidÂ the benefits of the vaccine

public health officials are monitoring five coronavirus variants circulating in the united states  all of which appear to spread more quickly than the originalÂ strain  scientists say those variants are the product of mutations spurred by the virus s spread  but online  an alternative explanation for the variants has taken hold  its source  nobel laureate who helped discover hiv   bombshell  nobel prize winner reveals   covid vaccine is  creating variants    reads the headline of may    article from rair foundation usa  an activist organization whose stated goal is to  combat the threats from islamic supremacists  radical leftists and their allies   the rair article  which has been shared widely on facebook  linked to an interview with french virologistÂ luc montagnier  who sharedÂ the      nobel prize in physiology or medicine with his colleagues for their discovery of hiv in       since then Â montagnier has promoted several unverified medical claims  including that long term antibiotic treatment can cure autism and that  good immune system  is enough to protect someone from aids  during the interview  which was done byÂ pierre barnÃ©riasÂ  filmmaker who produced documentary filled with debunked conspiracy theories about covid   Â Â montagnier blamed vaccination for the coronavirus variants  it is an unacceptable mistake   he said  according to the rair translation of the video Â  the history books will show that  because it is the vaccination that is creating the variants   that s wrong Â naturally occurring mutations are responsible for the coronavirus variants  not vaccines  experts and public health officials say vaccines can help prevent the development of new variants by slowing the rate of virus transmission  factcheck  nobel prize winner did not say covid    vaccine recipients have  no chance of survival   the mutation itself does not occur because of immunization   saidÂ dr Â stanley perlman  microbiology and immunology professor at the university of iowa Â  usa today reached out to rair foundation usa and montagnier for comment  public health officials sayÂ coronavirus variants are the result ofÂ changes to the virus s genes  every time virus replicates  mutations naturally occur in its genetic material  when rna viruses like sars cov  Â circulateÂ widely within population  they change and adapt over time Â one example is flu viruses  which change so frequently that new vaccine is needed each year  since the pandemic began  the coronavirus has infected more thanÂ     million people worldwide  according to data from johns hopkins university  that high caseload  as well as its geographic distribution  has given the virus ample opportunity to mutate  experts say   if you think about virus like tree growing and branching out Â each branch on the tree is slightly different than the others   the centers for disease control and prevention says on its website   these small differences  or variants  have been studied and identified since the beginning of the pandemic   coronavirus vaccines can help slow the evolution of theÂ virus  all three vaccines approved for emergency use in the u s  areÂ effective at reducing the spread of the coronavirus  as more americans have received the vaccine  new coronavirus cases have declined  that means the virus has fewerÂ opportunities to replicate  mutate and produce new variants  fact check  no definitive evidence covid    vaccine causes autoimmune disease perlmanÂ said there s no evidence the covid    vaccines will make variants worse in the long run  new variants emerge through the process of natural selection when that strainÂ is the one strong enough to overcome host s immune system evidence suggests variants are more likely to develop in populations that have weak immune response to the coronavirus  according to perlman and other experts   so  in essence  stressed out  high density human populations with poor access to health care are ideal settings for the origin and success of novel strains with novel mutations that can escape immune systems  or vaccines  and  at the same time  be more deadly   rob dunn  biologist and professor at north carolina state university  said in march   university blog post  fact check  peer reviewed studies have shown safety  efficacy of covid    vaccines in the video interview Â montagnier said the antibodies produced by the coronavirus vaccines  enable an infection to become stronger  Â  montagnier attributed that claim toÂ antibody dependent enhancement  ade   phenomenon in which virus specific antibodies can enhance the entry and replication of virus  those antibodies recognize and bind to pathogen  but instead of preventing infection  they act as  trojan horse  and allow the pathogen to enter cells  that process can lead to wider dissemination of the disease  ade has resulted from few previous vaccination efforts  including vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus andÂ measles in the     s and Â more recently  dengue virus in       scientists have looked for ade associated with the coronavirus throughout the pandemic  but they haven t found any cases  fact check  no  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine will not make your body bluetooth connectable  the fact is there is no ade  so that s why we re silent about it   perlman said  the claim that covid    vaccines are creating virus variants is false  based on our research  naturally occurring mutations in the coronavirus s genes are responsible for the variants  experts and public health officials say  widespread vaccination can help prevent theÂ development ofÂ new variants by slowing the spread of the virus,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

pfizer covid    vaccines are administered at providence edwards lifesciences vaccination site in santa ana  calif   on may            ap hong   viral instagram post claiming the covid    vaccines are far less effective than advertised is conflating different measures of efficacy to leave misleading impression  the covid    vaccines are highly effective  the pfizer vaccines     efficacy  for example  means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had     lower risk of becoming infected than those who received placebo  separate measure of vaccine efficacy was the subject of lancet microbe commentary  not peer reviewed study  the commentary did not argue that the vaccines do not work  or that the widely reported efficacy figures were inaccurate  an author of the commentary told politifact that the instagram post misinterprets it  widespread instagram post argues  wrongly  that new information has shown the covid    vaccines to be far less effective than advertised  the post errs by conflating two different calculations used to gauge the efficacy of vaccines  and it makes false conclusions based on that error Â   the lancet peer reviewed study confirms vaccine efficacy  not as     stated by the vaccine companies  but as  astrazeneca       moderna       j j       pfizer         says the may    instagram post  which received thousands of

cited in the post is lancet microbe commentary  not peer reviewed study  and one of its authors  along with other experts  said the posts interpretation is misleading   it is extremely disappointing to see how information can be twisted   said piero olliaro  professor of poverty related infectious diseases at the university of oxfords centre for tropical medicine and global health   we do not say vaccines do not work    screenshot of may           instagram post wrongly claiming the covid    vaccines are less effective than advertised  the person behind the instagram post did not respond to requests for comment  the covid    vaccines available for use in the u s  are highly effective  pfizers two dose vaccine  for example  was found in clinical trials to be     effective at preventing covid    infection  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention Â  the instagram post says that based on new information  the vaccine  went from     down to       effective   but thats not the case  the post mixes up two different measures of vaccine efficacy that can be calculated from the clinical trial data  both measures are expressed as percentages  but they describe different things  broadly speaking  one describes the probability of avoiding infection by getting vaccinated  the other represents the proportion of people in group who avoided infection as result of getting vaccinated  given their baseline risks  the commentary highlighted this second measure  when we hear that the pfizer vaccine has     efficacy  that doesnt mean    of recipients will get covid     instead  it means that the people who received the vaccine in clinical trials had     lower chance of becoming infected than those who received placebo Â  this vaccine efficacy figure is what epidemiologists refer to as the relative risk reduction Â  this is the measure thats commonly reported for vaccines  including the yearly flu shot  said natalie dean  assistant professor of biostatistics at the university of florida  its the  most immediately meaningful  indicator of efficacy because its easily generalizable  imagine that  one version of you is vaccinated and one version of you is unvaccinated   dean said  for vaccine with     efficacy as measured by relative risk reduction   the vaccinated version of you has     lower risk  lower chance of getting sick   the other measure is known as absolute risk reduction  this measure accounts for peoples baseline risks of getting covid     it changes across different groups and timeframes  depending on how likely certain population is to get covid    in the first place  without protection from the vaccine Â  richard watanabe  professor of preventive medicine at the university of southern california  defined absolute risk reduction as  the proportion of people in the population who do not develop disease  as result of getting the covid    vaccine  put differently  its the number of percentage points populations risk goes down by taking the vaccine   you can imagine that different people will have different baseline levels of risk  depending on where they live  what their occupation is  all different things   dean said   the people who had larger risk at baseline will have larger benefit  from the vaccine  in those absolute terms   both efficacy figures can be drawn from the clinical trial data  by comparing the percentage of vaccinated participants who got covid    with the percentage of unvaccinated participants who got covid     the relative risk reduction is calculated using ratio that divides one percentage by the other  while the absolute risk reduction takes the arithmetic difference between the two   the mathematical formulas are listed in table with the lancet commentary   the numbers that appeared in the instagram post come from the lancet commentary and were calculated by olliaros team  but theyre  on totally different scale  than the     and other vaccine efficacy numbers that were widely reported  dean said Â  the absolute risk reduction  looks much smaller than the relative effect   said matthew fox  professor of epidemiology at boston university   but remember  over the time the vaccine trials are run  only percentage of those in the study were exposed to covid  so most people would not be infected even if not vaccinated  so       absolute reduction is big reduction  and could result in dramatically fewer infections when we vaccinate the population   on its own  the absolute risk reduction can be hard to understand  olliaro said  but the figure can help with policymaking  because it can be used to estimate how many people need to be vaccinated in given population in order to prevent one additional case of covid     the posts claim that the covid    vaccine developers  deceived everyone  wrongly suggests that cover up was in effect to make the shots seem more efficacious than they are Â   the drug companies are not trying to hide anything   watanabe said   if you were competent scientist you could  like the authors of the lancet article  calculate the other metrics by hand using the data reported in the original new england journal of medicine papers   second  the post falsely claims that the lancet commentary proved the reported vaccine efficacy figures  such as pfizers      were wrong  those figures have since been backed by real world studies  including one that found the pfizer shot to be     effective  olliaro  who co wrote the lancet commentary  said its wrong to interpret the commentary  which has led to some back and forth among scholars  as saying the vaccines dont work  the commentary argued that vaccine developers should more prominently report absolute risk reductions alongside relative risk reductions in order to facilitate public health decisions and compare vaccines  olliaro said Â  but the  bottom line   olliaro said  is that  these vaccines are good public health interventions   an

source  byram bridle  lifesite news  on point with alex pierson     may      Â      review   in late may       the claim that covid    vaccines could cause blood vessel damage to vaccinated people went viral on social media platforms  including facebook  instagram  reddit  and twitter  many posts and articles  see examples hereÂ and here   like this article from lifesitenews  based this claim on    may      radio interview between the canadian broadcaster alex pierson and the immunologist byram bridle  the interview received more than        interactions on facebook  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  during the interview  bridle claimed that the spike protein produced through covid    vaccination  which generates immunity against the disease  enters the bloodstream and can damage the blood vessels and brain  scientists who reviewed this claim for health feedback found it misleading because it misrepresented the results from scientific studies and was based on cherry picked information  bridles claim was based on three assumptions  in this review  we explain why these three assumptions are unsupported by current evidence  coronaviruses are large family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses in animals and humans  they receive their name from crown  corona  in latin  of spikes made of protein that cover the surface of the virus when observed under an electron microscope  the spike protein allows the virus to enter the cells by binding to receptor called angiotensin converting enzyme    ace   that sits on the surface of some cells     an immune response against the spike protein could eliminate infected cells while preventing the virus from entering the cells and producing more viral particles  that is why the majority of covid    vaccines target this protein     these vaccines work by exposing the body to the spike protein of sars cov    the virus that causes covid     thereby training the immune system to respond more rapidly and effectively when it encounters the virus in the future  none of the covid    vaccines authorized for emergency use by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  contains the spike protein  instead  they instruct the cells to produce the protein on their own  viral vector based covid    vaccines  johnson   johnson and the oxford astrazeneca vaccine  authorized for emergency use in the european union and other countries but not in the u s   deliver the genetic instructions for making the protein in the form of dna  the genetic instructions are delivered within modified harmless version of an adenovirus similar to the one that causes the common cold  in contrast  mrna covid    vaccines  pfizer biontech and moderna  use mrna carried within fat droplets called lipid nanoparticles  although covid    is primarily respiratory disease  several studies showed that the disease causes cardiovascular damage in many patients  complications such as irregular heartbeat  blood clots  heart failure  and stroke can occur even after the patient recovers     bridle claimed that the spike protein alone is responsible for most of these vascular complications in covid    patients  he based his claim on several studies that we discuss below  which evaluated the effect of the spike protein on blood vessels  however  these studies provide insufficient data to support this claim  some studies found that sars cov   can indeed infect and damage endothelial cells       these cells line the inside of blood vessels and have the ace  receptors  making them susceptible to sars cov   infection  one of these studies found signs of endothelial damage and fragments of sars cov    including the spike protein  in the brains of    deceased covid    patients     when the researchers injected the spike protein into mice  the animals developed neurological symptoms and brain inflammation similar to that observed in covid    patients  later  small study by lei et al  at the salk institute reported endothelial damage in the lungs of hamsters injected with an engineered pseudovirus  particle that carried the sars cov   spike protein on its surface     in an email to health feedback  peter hotez  an expert in vaccinology and professor at baylor college of medicine  explained that this study looks at cellular mechanisms of how viral spike protein works  not the immune response from vaccine  julie bettinger  an associate professor at the vaccine evaluation centre at the university of british columbia  pointed out to health feedback  read bettingers comment in full below    the lei et al  study  actually concludes by stating  vaccination generated antibody and or exogenous antibody against s protein not only protects the host from sars cov   infectivity but also inhibits s protein imposed endothelial injury  that is  covid    vaccines may actually prevent vascular damage  therefore  covid    vaccines targeting the spike protein might protect the cells not only from sars cov   infection but also from the endothelial damage caused by the spike protein if the infection occurs  contradicting bridles claim  although the findings from both studies suggest that the spike protein of sars cov   could damage blood vessels  they dont provide evidence that this does occur in covid    patients  abraham al ahmad  an assistant professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the texas tech university  highlighted several limitations of this study in his response to health feedback  read al ahmads comment in full below   the first limitation is that the authors of the study didnt provide information about the type of pseudovirus they used in their study  which determines the behavior of the pseudovirus and how similar it is to the spike protein from sars cov    the second limitation is that we dont know the viral load  which is the amount of virus  injected into the animals and how it compares with the viral load in covid    patients  the third limitation is that results from animal studies often dont reflect what happens in human patients and require further validation in humans  al ahmad explained  we have some indications that sars cov   can be detrimental to endothelial cells  but at this point  we are lacking two important pieces of information     what is the blood plasma viral load we need in patient to show signs of endothelial cell damage  we only know these patients died from covid    complications      how does this viral load compare to the amount of spike protein displayed on  pseudo viruses  based on the experimental data presented in the study  therefore  bridles claim that the spike protein from sars cov   is alone responsible for blood clotting and other vascular symptoms in covid    patients remains unsupported at this point in time  the potential of the spike protein to cause vascular damage in covid    patients requires further investigation  bridles claim rests on the assumption that if the viral spike protein causes cardiovascular toxicity in covid    patients  the spike protein produced in vaccinated people should be toxic as well  however  this assumption is incorrect because there are important differences between the spike protein produced during infection and the spike protein produced by vaccination  while both mrna vaccines and viral vector vaccines carry the instructions to produce the entire spike protein  the cells break down much of the protein into small fragments  furthermore  unlike infection  the spike protein from covid    vaccination doesnt get assembled into new viral particles  instead  it contains component that makes it attach to the cell surface as it would do to the viral surface  finally  the spike protein produced by the u s  fda authorized covid    vaccines is genetically modified to enhance the immune response and prevent its binding to ace  receptors  based on methods developed in an earlier study     contrary to bridles assumption  these differences suggest that vaccine derived and infection derived spike protein behave very differently in the body  as the salk institute stated in press release  al ahmad explained  when it comes to covid   vaccines  cases of thrombosis  clotting  following covid   vaccines have been reported with the oxford astrazeneca and the johnson   johnson vaccines  however   the incidence of thrombosis following immunization is very likely to be below or similar to the background occurrence of such events in the population  the ema made it clear  the benefits still outweigh the very small perceived risk when it comes to clotting and cerebral venous thrombosis  in contrast  covid    makes infected individuals more likely to develop blood clots  which affect up to     of hospitalized covid    patients     covid    vaccines are injected in the upper arm muscle  where they instruct the muscle cells to produce the spike protein  most of the vaccine remains around the injection site  either in the muscle cells or in the lymph nodes responsible for the immune response  bridle claimed that this assumption is wrong  and the spike protein from covid    enters the bloodstream  accumulating in tissues such as the spleen  bone marrow  liver  adrenal glands  and ovaries  bridle based this claim on small study by ogata et al  that examined blood samples from people who received the moderna covid    vaccine and detected spike protein in    out of    vaccinated people     bettinger explained that the sample size of this study was very small  besides reporting that part of the vaccine derived spike protein enters the blood  nothing about being detrimental is mentioned in the publication  she added  ogata et al  found extremely low levels of the spike protein compared to the harmful levels reported in animal studies  as uri manor  one of the authors of the study in hamsters  pointed out on twitter  the blog deplatform disease calculated that the amount of spike protein that the authors found in vaccinated people was about         times lower than the levels of viral spike protein shown to cause harm  this is situation that could hypothetically occur in severe covid    patients  pending studies confirming it  but not achievable in vaccinated people  at least for those who received the moderna vaccine  and unlikely to occur for the other vaccines  explained al ahmad  while some of the vaccine might end up in the bloodstream  the body breaks it down over time  the european medicines agency  ema  explained in    march      letter that the proportion of vaccine that enters the bloodstream is very small and almost all of that ends up in the liver  the uptake of the mrna in the vaccine occurs mainly in macrophages and dendritic cells of the immune system at the site of injection and draining lymph nodes    it was found that the vaccines mrna  formulated inside lipid nanoparticles  remains mainly at the injection site and only small amounts can reach other tissues  such as the liver  regarding the covid    astrazeneca vaccine  upon administration of the same vector carrying another virus protein  it was found that most of the injected viral vector remained at the injection site  and only low amounts were detected in other tissues  the non clinical studies performed with the three covid    vaccines did not identify any safety concerns linked to their tissue distribution in the animal model under the experimental conditions used  al ahmad debunked in his blog bridles claim that mrna vaccines cross the blood brain barrier causing damage to the brain and other organs  the claim is based on purportedly leaked report from pfizer about the distribution of lipid nanoparticles  like those carrying the covid    vaccine  in mice  al ahmad explains that  despite the extremely high doses injected  the levels observed in the brain and other organs were very low  in addition to repeating bridles allegations  the lifesitenews article misused the u s  vaccine adverse event reporting system to make other misleading and unsupported claims  one example is the implication that the spike protein produced by covid    vaccines caused thousands of adverse events including the       deaths  and nearly        hospitalizations  it also stated that mrna covid    vaccines caused hundreds of cases of blood clots  such claims are unsubstantiated  besides the lack of evidence for any harmful effect of the spike protein produced by covid    vaccines  vaers reports alone dont provide evidence that covid    vaccines caused an adverse event  as health feedback explained in previous reviews here  here  and here  therefore  vaers reports of blood clotting dont prove that any component of the covid    vaccines  including the spike protein derived from them  damage blood vessels  the claim that the spike protein from covid    vaccination can cause vascular damage in vaccinated people is unsupported and misleading  while the potential effect of the spike protein produced during infection on blood vessels deserves further investigation  the claim that covid    vaccines will cause similar problems is unsubstantiated  in fact  the available evidence contradicts this claim  instead suggesting that covid    vaccines targeting the spike protein might not only protect against viral infection but also against vascular damage  al ahmad concluded  covid    vaccines have been given to over     million americans and have been shown to be extremely safe  associated with dramatic decrease in fatal covid    cases  hospitalization  and probably contribute to the overall decrease in transmission within the community  these are undeniable facts that contradict any claims made until now of vaccines causing blood clots     infertility     or brain heart damage  the study by ogata et al  published in clinical infectious diseases reports that part of the spike protein enters the blood     however  nothing about being detrimental is mentioned in the publication  these findings are also based on small sample size  scientists feedback   julie bettinger  associate professor  university british columbia  the study by lei et al  published in circulation research  done in hamsters  actually concludes by stating that vaccination generated antibody and or exogenous antibody against s protein not only protects the host from sars cov   infectivity but also inhibits s protein imposed endothelial injury     that is  covid    vaccines may actually prevent vascular damage  so the problem here is linking two completely unrelated studies  and the fact that the clots have only been found with viral vector vaccines  there is massive leap between the two studies  and the lifesitenews article is cherry picking what is presented  is the spike protein toxic to endothelial cells  causing blood clots  heart  and brain damage  an interesting pattern with the anti vaccine crowd is the inappropriate use of scientific literature or the cherry picking of poor studies to make bold claims in an attempt to vilify vaccines  as seen in this latest instance citing rapid communication from lei and colleagues published in circulation research     the latest trend amongst anti vaccine groups is the claim that the spike  s  protein produced by covid    vaccines is toxin  and it damages various tissues  including endothelial cells  what is the science behind the claim  and how does it hold up under scrutiny  in this rebuttal  i will specifically address the claim with regards to the endothelial cell perspective     covid    and vasculitis endothelial cells damage  still work in progress situation endothelial cells are type of cells lining the inside of our blood vessels  from big caliber arteries to fine microvessels deep inside our tissues  it is type of cell that emerges early during development from mesoderm lineage  the same embryonic lineage that will give rise to connective tissues  including muscles and bones   endothelial cells play important roles as physical and chemical filter between the circulating blood and the peripheral tissues  as mesh  they retain blood cells and plasma proteins inside the blood vessels and participate in the regulation of blood pressure by secreting relaxing factors  e g   nitric oxide  endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor  for the muscle cells lining blood vessels  in certain tissues  e g   brain  eyes  or testis   such endothelial cells can be further specialized  resulting in much more tightened barrier phenotype that acts as strict barrier  such as the blood brain barrier  bbb  observed in the brain  however  endothelial cells are very fragile cells that can be damaged by various agents  one of these potential hazardous agents may be sars cov   itself  the virus responsible for the covid    pandemic  the first high impact study that documented possible vascular endothelial damage in patients was the study from varga and colleagues  published last year in the lancet journal     which reported the presence of endothelial lesions in both classical histological  stained tissues with chemicals  and electron microscopy preparations of two deceased covid    patients  however  such studies have limitations  as reported in letter to the editor few weeks following its publication      highlighting few limitations and caveats of such observations  another study by nuovo and colleagues also reported endothelial cell damage    before the circulation research study by lei and colleagues     nuovo and colleagues reported similar observations in post mortem tissues of    deceased covid    patients  as well as neurological alterations in mice infected with spike protein via iv infusion  full length or s  fraction  at dose considered very high    micrograms     microliters or    micrograms milliliter per mouse   this study also reported endothelial cell damage in the blood vessels of the brain on post mortem tissues  but fell short of indicating the presence of fully functional virions  the authors reported the presence of pseudovirions  lacking the presence of sars cov   rna in most preparations   at this point  we have some indications that sars cov   can be detrimental to endothelial cells  but we are lacking two important pieces of information     what is the blood plasma viral load we need in patient to show signs of endothelial cell damage  we only know these patients died from covid    complications      how does this viral load compare to the amount of spike protein displayed on  pseudo viruses  based on the experimental data presented in the study  we must consider whether any studies showing the transport and or toxicity of spike protein reflect an amount that can be achieved realistically in covid    patients     the lei et al  rapid communication in circulation research rapid short communications are type of scientific article commonly encountered in the literature when you have discovery that is so important that it needs to be shared  but you have not been able to conduct significant number of experiments to have study as whole  short communications are essential to break important findings  but they also come with the peril encountered by preliminary studies  we are lacking confirmatory experiments  we are often having limited number of experiments done that can show similar outcomes with different approaches  and more dangerously  they can be interpreted by non scientists as irrefutable evidence  quite often  these short communications provide more questions than answers  and due to their limited word count  often leave important information out  one of the problems of working with the sars cov   virus is the high risk associated with manipulating such virus  it is highly infectious and easily spread via aerosols and droplets  making its manipulation in cell culture high risk activity for the researcher  as of now  any work involving the culture and maintenance of infectious sars cov   requires the use of biosafety level    bsl    research facility to conduct such experiments  including the culture of functional viruses  as comparison  hiv only requires bsl    laboratory  bacteria such as mycobacterium tuberculosis  which is the causative agent of tuberculosis  requires bsl   facility  these laboratories require special facilities and engineering controls to avoid biological agents escaping outside the lab  in addition to trained personnel for manipulating these agents  in this short communication  lei and colleagues circumvented the issue by creating pseudoviruses that express spike protein on their viral shell  here is the first caveat  we dont have any information about the type of pseudoviruses used  are these aggregates of spike proteins like the novavax vaccine candidates  are these adenoviruses encoding for the spike protein  are these syrian hamster specific viruses used for that purpose since the animals infected are syrian hamsters  the second caveat is we dont know what the viral load given to the animals is  furthermore  is the expression of spike protein by these pseudoviruses comparable to sars cov   virions  and the third  the use of syrian hamsters  it is always dangerous to jump from animals to humans assuming it will be comparable  translation from the bench to the bedside remains an extremely dangerous and risky procedure  as most interventions and drug candidates fail to translate efficacy observed on the bench into clinically relevant therapy  it is important to note that the authors reported an inoculum of     pfu  acronym for plaque formation unit  which represents the number of infectious or live viruses in preparation  per ml      million ml   using only very small size  n   animals per experiment  for in vivo studies  usually  minimum number of n   per group is not unheard of for animal studies to achieve minimal statistical significance  we dont have any idea how this inoculum compares to clinical information  is that viral load comparable to humans  if yes  at which clinical stage  we also know that the in vitro studies were conducted in the presence of recombinant s  protein  genetically produced viral protein  not the natural and full form of the protein present in viral particles  this is important because it also means that the use of recombinant proteins may miss the sugar branching or glycosylation found in the natural form of the protein as found in sars cov   viruses      the amount used was   microgram  one millionth of gram  ml  which also appears pretty excessive  to put this into perspective  buzhdygan and colleagues     used    nanomolar     nanomoles per liter  which equals      molecules of protein  per liter  of the recombinant spike protein s  domain in cultured human brain endothelial cells  concentration considered sufficient to observe statistically significant damage in brain endothelial cells  if we assume molecular weight of     kda  it would result in concentration of     microgram per liter  or     nanograms ml   recent study by ogata and colleagues    reported the detection of spike protein in the plasma of patients following immunization with the moderna vaccine  which was barely over the limit of detection  the authors noted values up to      picograms  one thousand billionth of gram  per ml  peak concentration  during the first week after the first injection  no subsequent peak and detection above detection levels were observed after the second injection  no full length spike protein was detected at any time  and no nucleocapsid protein was detected in either of the patients  which allows us to rule out any shedding from covid    naturally  it is important to compare the values  we indicate possible damage if you expose cells and animals to       micrograms ml  with study injecting    micrograms ml in mice   these values have yet to be compared to values observed in patients plasma serum  but they are at least    times higher than the plasma concentration observed in moderna vaccinated patients and may require       times that concentration to see actual damage in humans  in vitro on cultured brain endothelial cells   situation that could hypothetically occur in severe covid    patients  pending studies confirming it  but not achievable in vaccinated people  at least for those who received the moderna vaccine  and unlikely to occur for the other vaccines     what about the clotting  in the article  bridle makes the following statement  when that happens it can do one of two things  it can either cause platelets to clump  and that can lead to clotting  thats exactly why weve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines  it can also lead to bleeding  here is conundrum of the statement  you cannot be the coagulopathic agent that is prothrombotic  generate blood clots and stop blood flow in vessel  and be antithrombotic  which results in bleeding  at the same time  the ace  receptor appears to exert an antithrombotic activity under normal conditions  therefore we can assume tampering with such receptor can contribute to clot formation      what we know for now is that there is high incidence of clotting events in covid    cases  there are various reports which indicate that up to         out      of hospitalized covid    patients present signs of coagulation  clotting issues      when it comes to covid    vaccines  cases of thrombosis  clotting  following covid    vaccination have been reported with the oxford astrazeneca and johnson   johnson vaccines  by early spring       several cases of coagulopathy resulting in cerebral venous thrombosis  cvt  were documented in various countries utilizing such vaccines  both of which are non mrna vaccines   cvt accounts for      of all stroke admissions  according to bousser and ferro      to put these into perspective  the european union  eu  experienced      million stroke events in           which would give us an estimate of     stroke events per         people  hence  the number of cvts occurring in the eu population could be estimated by     per         persons  according to the european medicines agency     cases of cvt were reported following the immunization of    million people with the oxford astrazeneca covid    vaccine  this number brings us to an estimate of      per         people  in other words  the incidence of cvt following immunization is very likely to be below or similar to the background occurrence of such events in the population  the ema made it clear  the benefits still outweigh the very small perceived risk when it comes to clotting and cvt     what about the heart and brain  what about the distribution of the vaccine in the body  earlier reports commented on heart anomalies in young patients  around    to   years old  following immunization with the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  so far  the reports of this myocarditis  heart damage  are rare  mostly mild  and still under monitoring  however  the incidence of these cases doesnt seem to be above the baseline rate  when it comes to the distribution of the covid    vaccines in the body  and damage to the brain and other organs   the lifesitenews article goes even further into fear mongering  giving platform to stephanie seneff  computer scientist at the massachusetts institute of technology  who is well known anti genetically modified organisms  gmo  activist  seneff is known for her questionable claim that half of all children will be autistic by       spoiler alert  the incidence of autism in the general population in      was   in    people  based on      data   citing the use of glyphosate  common herbicide used in agriculture for the past    years  as the main culprit  such bold and unsubstantiated claim has even been denounced by certain gmo skeptics  questioning the credibility of seneff as an authority figure on that topic      in the lifesitenews article  seneff went as far as to claim that the results of this leaked pfizer study tracing the biodistribution of the vaccine mrna are not surprising  but the implications are terrifying  i have personally discussed these biodistribution data  as obtained by bridle and colleagues  on my blog  as i teach pharmacokinetics to pharmacy students  the data is pretty clear  the number of vaccines needed to be injected in    year old to reproduce the findings observed in rats and reported as terrifying would be equivalent to        doses given at once  to reproduce the number of nanoparticles used in that study  at this point  neurological damage from covid    vaccines remains to be documented  but neurological damage from covid    itself is common  such damage can be multifactorial  and it remains unclear what the contributing factors are  the high expression of ace  in the nasal cavity could be one point of entry for the virus to invade the brain      the hypoxemia  decreased oxygen saturation in the blood  that is major issue encountered in covid    patients  since neurons are extremely susceptible to hypoxic injury   and the systemic inflammation associated with covid    that can activate the brain endothelium and possibly drive some neuroinflammation     concluding remarks here is the great peril of anti vaccine and fear mongering disinformation spreaders  twist and exaggerate claims  these studies are reflecting near impossible scenario that requires ridiculous amount of spike protein that has yet to match clinically relevant concentrations  yet much higher than values observed in small studies  covid    vaccines have been given to over     million americans and have been shown to be extremely safe  associated with dramatic decrease in fatal covid    cases  hospitalization  and probably contribute to the overall decrease in transmission within the community  these are undeniable facts that contradict any claims made up to now of vaccines causing blood clots  coagulopathy occurs in much higher number of covid    patients than covid    vaccinated patients and seems limited to the use of adenovirus based vaccines such as the oxford astrazeneca vaccine   infertility  several cases of pregnancies occurred in volunteers enrolled in the pfizer biontech and moderna clinical trials  no

various forms since early in the covid    pandemic  it includes picture of the pope with his head bowed below text that says  the holy father  pope francis has requested everyone to say this prayer  another version of the post  from july       has been shared more than      times and generated more than      reactions  many of the comments on both posts echo the affirmation amen  the words attributed to pope francis do not appear among the catholic leaders public statements or edicts  while the purported prayer request runs against the popes many statements calling for the widespread use of covid    vaccines  the reverend kevin waldie  lecturer in biblical studies at te kupenga catholic theological college in auckland  said there is no documentary evidence for the prayer emanating from the pope  which is an indication that the post should be dismissed as mischievous manipulation  what is being claimed does not fit with anything that pope francis regularly is reported to have said  dr waldie told aap factcheck  adding  he is totally in favour of the vaccination regime and has made that clear  version of the post from april was declared false here  search for the phrase no

francis says publicly  particularly about covid     as far as i am aware  pope francis has never said that  it would also seem to contradict his urging everyone in january to be vaccinated  in an interview with italian media broadcast on january     the pope said  i believe that ethically everyone must take the vaccine  it is an ethical option  because you risk your health  your life  but you also risk the lives of others  the pope added that he was receiving the vaccine next week  we will start doing it here  in the vatican  and i have booked  it must be done  both pope francis and pope emeritus benedict xvi have since received two doses of covid    vaccines  according to reports  dr waldie said the posts were nefarious campaign that could be linked to literal reading of new testament passages such as mark        which reads  they will pick up snakes with their hands  and when they drink deadly poison  it will not hurt them at all  they will place their hands on sick people  and they will get well  it was reported in january that the vatican would launch its own vaccination campaign against covid    for the approximately     people resident there  the pope has also supported waiving patent rights to boost vaccine supplies to poorer countries  calling for universal access to the vaccine  meanwhile  vatican statement on december    sought to ease catholics concerns about the ethics of receiving vaccines that were developed using stem cells  the note  approved by the pope  said there was moral imperative for the pharmaceutical industry  governments and international organizations to ensure that vaccines  which are effective and safe from medical point of view  as well as ethically acceptable  are also accessible to the poorest countries in manner that is not costly for them  there is no evidence that the pope recited the prayer in the post or requested people to repeat it  the suggestion that he believes people can be vaccinated by the blood

does new study confirm the covid    vaccine is not     effective  no  that s not true  it s not study at all but comment in the lancet  and it says vaccines do work at high efficiency level  the

is reported as relative risk reduction  rrr  which gave the     everyone was talking about  this does not include background risk of becoming infected  which varies between populations and length of time arr is never reported  because it considers the whole population  and is the difference between infection with and without we aren t told about the arr because they are purposely ignored because they give much different story  which is much less impressive  your pheyezur schmaccine just went from     down to       effective there are many different ways researcher can lie with statistical reports  google the book title  how to lie with statistics   did i mention that that is one of schilly billy s favorites  piero olliaro  professor of poverty related infectious diseases at the university of oxford and one of the authors of the lancet comment  explained its intention and results to lead stories via email on may           it is extremely disappointing to see how information can be twisted and how divisive discussions have become especially on covid    vaccines  as they obviously overlap with general vaccine hesitancy and antivax segments of the population bottom line  these vaccines are good public health interventions  importantly  the effects of vaccination should not be seen merely as reducing individual risk  but its effects on reducing the risk in the entire population  with all its ramifications   reducing stress to health systems  hospital bed occupancy  societal costs  effects on economy  etc  long list we do not say vaccines do not work  we say vaccines do work  and add considerations about intrinsic vaccine efficacy and their effectiveness when used in different populations  we say that  it is incorrect to compare vaccine based on clinical trials conducted in different conditions  using relative risk reduction  rrr calculated as explained in the paper   and assume vaccines with lower rrr do not work well enough  studies should therefore report also absolute risk reduction  arr  calculated as explained in the paper   why  the rrr is measure of vaccine efficacy in preventing disease in those at risk of getting infected and becoming ill  the arr is measure of vaccine effectiveness in population where certain proportion of individuals will get diseased without vaccine  arr is more difficult to understand  but can be conveniently translated in nnv  number need to vaccinate   how many people need to be vaccinated in population with given background risk of getting covid    without vaccine to prevent one more case of covid      the article explains these concepts with numerical examples from vaccine trials  and that even vaccines with relatively lower rrr are totally worthy  these numbers are evidence of effectiveness  since even the least  effective  vaccine  astra zeneca and j j with rrr of       you just need to vaccinate     people to prevent one case in populations where just under    of people get covid    within certain period of time  this also shows that   vaccines with very similar  high efficacy  rrr       can have different effectiveness depending again on the risk of covid     nnv for moderna vaccine      pfizer       the latter was studied in the population with the lowest risk of all   olliaro and his colleagues published this response to criticism  it is customary yet inappropriate to compare vaccine efficacies and make policy decisions solely on relative risk reduction  rrr  from clinical trials with different protocols in populations with different background risks for covid     unless vaccines were tested within common trial as advocated by who  rrr focusses on those who benefit from the vaccine and  although more stable across event rates  levels of risk for covid      its interpretation requires knowing the actual background risk and its variability  absolute risk reduction  arr  considers all individuals and translates conveniently into number needed to vaccinate within population with given risk  but its public health significance varies with the risk  for any given rrr  arr is higher when event rates are higher  eg  earlier into vaccination programme  or in high risk groups  and decreases as risks decline both arr and rrr are helpful to assess trade offs between benefits and harm  because evidence is still limited on whether or how they change across the range of individual responses and risks related to age  comorbidities  behaviours  and level of exposure  as well as over time  with risk of covid    decreasing with vaccination scale up or altering

research before you get vaccine  begins an april          facebook post  the identical post was shared by one account into multiple public facebook groups with thousands of members  more than     million covid    shots have been administered in the united states    an immunization campaign that has been targeted by inaccurate claims about vaccines  below  afp fact check examines the claims in the post  claim  dr  michael yeadon former chief research scientist at pfizer has indicated covid vaccine is mass sterilization because it carries syncytin   spike protein  afp examined yeadons claimÂ about the syncytin   spike protein in december      and found it to be false  syncytin   is protein essential for placental formation  but dervila keane  pfizer spokeswoman  said  it has been incorrectly suggested that covid    vaccines will cause infertility because of very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of sars cov   virus that is shared with the placental protein  syncytin   Â  the sequence shares just four amino acids and is therefore too short to plausibly give rise to autoimmunity  or prompting the bodys immune system to attack its own cells  she said  dasantila golemi kotra  microbiologist at york university  agreed Â  the immune system can recognize surface in their target protein  which rarely is confined to single short amino acid sequence  she said  claims that the covid    vaccine will impact fertility have been shown to increase vaccine hesitancy Â Â  but joint statement from the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists  the american society for reproductive medicine and the society for maternal fetal medicine said  there is no evidence that the vaccine can lead to loss of fertility  claim  dr  geert vanden bossche  ph d   vaccinology insider and former global director of vaccine programs  who worked for the bill   melinda gates foundation  has called for an immediate stop for the mass vaccination campaign against covid    due to its extreme potential dangers to millions of people  afp investigated claims by vanden bossche after he published an open letter in march       and found them to be false  he argued that mass vaccination would lead to out of control variants  but experts said it is crucial to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible to limit the risk of new variants emerging  joe grove  virologist at the institute of immunity and transplantation at university college london  said  if were worried about the covid    becoming some super virus  the best way to stop that is to stop it from replicating and the best way to do that is vaccines  this was confirmed by scott halperin  director of the canadian centre for vaccinology  if we rapidly achieve high levels of population immunity through vaccination  the risk of variant emergence is decreased because there are insufficient numbers of susceptible individuals to continue the propagation of the virus and spread through the community  he said  claim  thousands of people have been reported dead on the cdc adverse event reporting system following their vaccination  lengthy disclaimer about the us vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  that users must acknowledge they have read and understood before accessing its data makes clear that information it contains is not proof that vaccine caused harm  the reports

taken from vaers have been inaccurately cited on facebook and instagram as evidence that covid    vaccines are causing thousands of deaths  claim not supported by us health authorities investigations  the us centers for disease control and prevention has condemned efforts to misrepresent the systems data  saying statements implying deaths following vaccination equate to deaths caused by vaccination are scientifically inaccurate  misleading  and simply irresponsible  claim  these experimental gene therapy jabs have bypassed animal and adequate human testing  this is false  in the us  three covid    vaccines have been authorized for emergency use by the us food and drug administration  fda   all three companies disclosed the results of trials on non human subjects in official statements  the vaccines created an immune response that protected animals against sars cov   infection  according to the companies press releases  kirk leech  executive director of the european animal research association and akiko iwasaki  an immunobiologist at yale university  confirmed that testing on animals took place during the development of covid    vaccines  tens of thousands of people participated in pfizer biontech and moderna covid    vaccine clinical trials  claim  life insurance companies will deny vaccine injuries and death compensation due to covid vaccines because if  sic  their experimental nature  the american council of life insurers  acli  said that the claim is false information  in statement published on its website on march           an acli senior vice president paul graham  said  life insurance policy contracts are very clear on how policies work  and what cause  if any  might lead to the denial of benefit  vaccine for covid    is not one of them  he continued

source  wendy bell  wendy bell radio     may      Â      review   the u s  vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  is surveillance system that helps ensure the safety of vaccines used in the u s  however  vaers reports have been commonly misused to spread misinformation about vaccine safety  particularly in the context of the covid    pandemic  one example is this image  posted on facebook by wendy bell on    may       that used vaers reports to claim that covid    vaccines caused as many deaths among young adults as covid    itself  this comparison is misleading because vaers reports alone dont demonstrate that covid    vaccines caused deaths  as health feedback explained in previous reviews here  here  and here  furthermore  covid    poses serious health risks to people besides death  including potentially long term health problems in survivors  as we explain below  under the title covid vaccine deaths  the post presented data from the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   implying that covid    vaccines caused the death of         of the people who received them  this figure comes from multiplying the number of deaths reported to vaers as of    may             death reports  by     and dividing it by the number of covid    vaccine doses administered in the u s  at that time      million doses   while the data are accurate  the implication that covid    vaccines are responsible for these deaths is incorrect and misuses vaers reports  vaers is an open access system that allows reporting of any health problems that occur after vaccination  from mild symptoms to serious medical events  the system collects information from anyone who wants to submit report  regardless of what caused the adverse event  hence vaers contains incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental  or unverifiable information  as the website clearly warns  this means that vaers reports alone cannot demonstrate that vaccine caused an adverse event  contrary to what the post claimed  because of the emergency use authorization for the covid    vaccines  healthcare providers bear the legal responsibility of reporting any serious adverse event following their use  this includes any deaths among vaccinated individuals  even if they are clearly unrelated to the vaccine  then  the cdc and the fda investigate each death report to determine whether it might be associated with the vaccine  as of    may       the u s  administered almost     million doses of covid    vaccines  during that time  vaers received       reports of death           among covid    vaccine recipients  as the cdc explains  none of these deaths has been definitively attributed to the vaccine  safety monitoring identified type of severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis in about two to five people per million vaccinated against covid    with an mrna vaccine  this reaction generally occurs within    minutes after vaccination and can be effectively treated  recently  vaers received    confirmed reports of blood clots with low platelets among individuals who received the johnson and johnson covid    vaccine  despite possible causal link between the johnson and johnson covid    vaccine and rare cases of blood clots  the cdc concluded that the vaccines known and potential benefits outweighed its known and potential risks  while the cdc and fda will continue to monitor the safety of all covid    vaccines  serious safety problems are rare  safety data from clinical trials and monitoring of ongoing vaccination campaigns are reassuring and demonstrate that fda authorized covid    vaccines are highly effective in preventing covid          most people experience no or mild side effects  which may include pain or swelling at the injection site  fever  chills  tiredness  and headache  but in general  these effects go away in few days  based on vaers reports  the post also claimed that from   may to    may       covid    vaccines caused     deaths  which equates to    deaths per day  apart from the fact that this is misuse of vaers reports as explained above  this claim lacks important context  making it misleading  the reality is that many people die every day for many reasons  to put this number in context  the u s  reported in      an average of       daily deaths  assuming that the u s  population is similar to that in      and considering that       of them received at least one dose of the covid    vaccine  we would expect about       deaths per day  comparing that figure with that presented by bell shows that    deaths each day dont indicate problem with vaccine safety  we can only infer that the vaccine might cause deaths if the number of deaths among vaccinated individuals exceeded the expected number of deaths in unvaccinated individuals  however  public health authorities havent observed higher rates of death among vaccinated individuals than in the unvaccinated population  as health feedback covered in this previous review  the post claims that covid    survivability of people under    years is          this number comes from dividing the number of covid    deaths in people under    by      million  it is unclear what the      million represents as we couldnt find source that matches this number  the implication that disease with high survival rate poses minor health risk is misleading because it fails to consider other important factors that impact the burden of disease  for example  virus with low lethality but high transmissibility may cause more infections and deaths than more deadly virus that only infects few people  such is the case of covid     where its rapid spread caused more than    million infections and         deaths in the u s  as of    may       such simplistic view also overlooks the potential long term consequences of covid    infection  growing clinical evidence shows that covid    outcomes go far beyond death or recovery  while children and young people are indeed less likely to develop severe covid     some of them do  particularly those with underlying health conditions like obesity  one study published in jama internal medicine showed that covid    caused over        hospitalizations and     deaths among children between march and december       furthermore  among the covid    patients aged    to    that required hospitalization      needed ventilation  and      died     though young people have high chance of surviving covid     some continue suffering long covid  even if they only had mild or no covid    symptoms  symptoms include loss of smell and taste  extreme fatigue  shortness of breath  and cognitive issues that can last for weeks or months     as health feedback explained in this earlier review  covid    infections might also cause lifelong problems in some survivors  including permanent lung and heart damage and neurological issues       these long lasting symptoms can significantly impair patients recovery and highly impact their quality of life  finally  the post suggests that only             of the total reported covid    deaths          as of    may       were actually caused by covid     according to the cdc  this claim is inaccurate and misinterprets how deaths are certified  as the cdc explains on its website     is the percentage of deaths in which covid    was the only cause mentioned  however  just because other death certificates listed additional conditions  it doesnt mean that these conditions caused the death  as health feedback explained in previous reviews  deaths are classified as covid    deaths only if the sequence of clinical events leading to the patients death is compatible with covid     furthermore  some of the conditions listed on death certificates  such as respiratory failure  may not be pre existing conditions but consequence of covid    itself  in summary  the claim that covid    vaccines are as unsafe to children and young adults as the disease itself is unsupported and misleading  vaers death reports alone dont demonstrate that covid    vaccines caused an adverse event  and therefore  dont provide evidence that covid    vaccines caused deaths or are unsafe  although children and young adults are very unlikely to die of covid     the disease poses other health risks  such as long lasting effects  even in people who only had mild or no covid    symptoms    coronavirus

facebook video shared to an australia based page includes claims that people vaccinated for covid    wont be allowed on flights because the vaccine makes them infectious  people arent going to be able to fly because theyre infectious after they have the vaccination  man speaking in the video says  so airlines dont want to let them on if they have had the vaccination  but they cant let them on if they havent  i mean  this whole thing is just f   ing ridiculous  the statement is made around four minutes into six minute video of the man speaking to the camera about face masks and other measures to tackle covid     the video was published by facebook page that promotes anti lockdown rallies in australia  the us and the uk  at the time of writing  the post had been viewed more than        times  generating more than      shares and      comments and reactions  there is no credible evidence that airlines do not want to take on passengers who have been vaccinated for covid     or that they have any plans to prevent vaccine recipients from flying  airline representatives told aap factcheck that vaccines are an important tool for getting people back in the sky  rather than being potential barrier to travel  the claim about people being infectious after vaccination seems to be based on the false premise that covid    vaccines can shed from one person to another  as explained in recent aap factcheck debunk  it is scientifically impossible for covid    vaccines to pass from person to person as the vaccines contain no live virus or any other infectious material  similar claims have been disproved here  here  here and here  google news search brings up hundreds of news stories about the prospect of mandatory vaccinations for airline passengers  sometimes referred to as vaccination passports  but aap factcheck could find no credible reports about airlines banning vaccinated passengers  considering such policies or raising concerns about taking these passengers on board  the international air transport association  iata   the global trade association for     airlines  representing    per cent of total air traffic  refutes the idea that vaccines are an impediment to travel  an iata spokesman told aap factcheck the opposite was true  the industry is of the view that vaccines have an important role to play in the restart and recovery of international travel  iatas head of corporate communications  albert tjoeng  said in an email  we see vaccination as facilitating people travelling  not to prevent travel  an iata position paper on vaccination and air travel notes that vaccines have proven very successful at reducing both infection and onward transmission of covid     saying the risk of virus transmission by recipients is very significantly reduced  relative to non vaccinated travellers  iata does not support mandatory vaccinations for international travel  it says  because this would discriminate against travellers who cannot access the vaccine in their home country or are unable to have the jab for other reasons  qantas and virgin australia both dismissed the idea they have considered preventing vaccinated passengers from boarding planes  spokeswoman for qantas told aap factcheck the airline has never mentioned banning vaccinated people from travel  and its ceo alan joyce has spoken on many occasions in support of covid    vaccinations for airline passengers  she pointed to media conference on april    in which mr joyce suggested vaccination should be requirement of international travel  he told media at the time  i would say that we are regarded as being the safest airline in the world and as consequence of that we have duty of care to our people and duty of care to our passengers  we do think it should be requirement that people are vaccinated on our aircraft to minimise the risk to people travelling  mr joyce similarly told the bbc in march that many governments were talking about making vaccinations condition of entry for international travel  even if this didnt happen  airlines should enforce their own vaccination policies  he added  we have duty of care to our passengers and to our crew  to say that everybody in that aircraft needs to be safe  mr joyce said  qantas statement on vaccinations and international travel  published in november  said there is no suggestion that vaccine would be required for domestic travel or travel to new zealand but it is likely that some countries and possibly airlines will require passengers to be vaccinated before travel  qantas acknowledged in the statement that an alternative process was needed for people who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons  spokesman for virgin australia told aap factcheck via email  it is highly unlikely that we would make vaccination compulsory for domestic flights  nor are we considering placing restrictions on vaccinated travellers  we will  of course  continue to consider relevant government and health advice around vaccination and will make any decisions in line with passenger and crew health and safety  in statement on may     the airline noted it was only matter of time until we will be sufficiently vaccinated to protect our people and our hospital system to open our international borders  there is no basis for the claim that people who receive covid    vaccination will be unable to fly or will be barred by airlines  airlines have refuted the suggestion  which runs counter to their public positions on vaccinations  claims that covid    vaccines make people infectious have

in may       widely shared letter purportedly written by musician eric clapton described the musicians disastrous experience after having received the second dose of the covid    astrazeneca vaccine that left him wondering  the letter said  if he would play guitar again Â  the letter was shared by robin monotti  friend of claptons and vocal opponent of covid    lockdown measures  on the telegram app  post archived here   it went viral after the letter was published on may    by americas frontline doctors  an right leaning group that has repeatedly peddled misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic and publicly spoken out against the covid    vaccine Â  the group claimed that monotti  an architect and film producer  forwarded the letter to them after receiving it from clapton  monotti then shared the article written by americas frontline doctors on twitter Â  eric clapton after covid vaccination   i should never have gone near the needle   https   t co kivkglvdvh  robin monotti

email was sent to him directly by clapton as message to share with the members of his telegram channel and group  i can also confirm it was indeed eric clapton who sent it directly to me as i met him personally  and at our meeting  we discussed the content of the message  monotti wrote in an email  snopes asked monotti to share screenshot of the message to confirm but we have not received response to our request  we found that rolling stone reported that the publication had confirmed that the letter had been sent by clapton  but snopes was not able to independently verify this  we have reached out to the publication and booking agent for clapton but have not received response  in mid june       video of clapton surfaced on twitter that showed the musician making similar allegations  full version of the video was produced by oracle films  self described group of filmmakers that have joined the fight for open debate and freedom information in the face of global government encroachment and big tech censorship  access to videos posted on the platform is only made available to subscribed members Â  the vaccine took my immune system and just shook it around again  and thats still going on  then i read lot of the evidence that ive been reading about with people who were having adverse reactions and that was on the list  you know  damage to the immune system  said clapton  when clapton was asked if he felt like he had been made aware of the potential side effects of the second jab  he replied  god  no  i lost the use of my hands for about three weeks  so i thought i was in real trouble  and thats about that point i was invited by robert monotti to talk about it because then  and it was easy to say yes because i realized by then that i wasnt the only one that was suffering  added clapton  my fear about vaccination is what will it do to my children  eric clapton had serious side effects after having the covid shot  pic twitter com v  kkfm qn  darren of plymouth

however  our own investigation into the side effects of the astrazeneca covid    vaccine found that the symptoms the letter described are rare  but could be real  i took the first jab of az and straight away had severe reactions which lasted ten days  i recovered eventually and was told it would be twelve weeks before the second one said the letter Â  about six weeks later i was offered and took the second az shot  but with little more knowledge of the dangers  the letter continued  needless to say the reactions were disastrous  my hands and feet were either frozen  numb or burning  and pretty much useless for two weeks  i feared i would never play again   i suffer with peripheral neuropathy and should never have gone near the needle   but the propaganda said the vaccine was safe for everyone  the letter went on to describe meeting member of an unnamed group who cautioned him against the vaccine  giving him sense that veil had been lifted Â  i felt like veil had been lifted  that i was no longer alone  that it was okay  in fact essential  to hold on to my intuition and follow my heart the letter continued  before going on to promote newly released song that clapton had recorded with van morrison called where have all the rebels gone Â  we found that it is true that the astrazeneca vaccine  which has not been approved in the u s   comes with its own dose of reported side effects  some of which resemble the symptoms described in the letter attributed to clapton  the u k  medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency noted that the two dose vaccine is injected into the muscle of the upper arm with the second dose given between four and    weeks after the first injection  like all medicines  this vaccine can cause side effects  although not everybody gets them  in clinical studies with the vaccine  most side effects were mild to moderate in nature and resolved within few days with some still present week after vaccination  wrote the agency Â  very common side effects include flu like symptoms and tenderness where the injection was given  as well as fatigue  headache  nausea  chills or feeling feverish  and muscle or joint pain  of course  it is possible that clapton experienced what the health agency described as uncommon effects that may affect up to one in     people  which include abdominal pain and enlarged lymph nodes  or that he may have experienced extremely rare side effects described in clinical trials  in clinical trials there were very rare reports of events associated with inflammation of the nervous system  which may cause numbness  pins and needles  and or loss of feeling  however  it is not confirmed whether these events were due to the vaccine  wrote the agency  following temporary distribution halt of the astrazeneca vaccine due to its potential link between the vaccine and rare blood clotting condition  the european medicines agency argued that the benefits of slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus far outweigh the potential of severe side effects  if the letter is authentic  clapton joins list of other celebrities who have spoken out against lockdown measures that have curtailed

facebook post claims that people who are unvaccinated against covid    are becoming ill just by being in the vicinity of those who have had the vaccine  in bizarre turn of events  the covid vaxxed are apparently causing ill effects to the unvaccinated around them  as countless reports and anecdotes affirm  the post says  it goes on to claim that the more time goes by  the more horrible effects of the covid vaccine  which is not vaccine but medical device and experimental gene therapy  come to light  the lengthy post lists alleged examples of illnesses and injuries unvaccinated people have picked up from vaccinated people  these include irregular and heavy menstruation  bleeding while pregnant and miscarriages as well as supposed cases of pets dying when touched by someone who got the covid jab  much of the text has been copied from an article published on april    by conspiracy promoting alternative media website that calls covid    an imaginary virus  the post was published on april    by an australian managed facebook page that was created in march       similar claims have been made in other posts from anti vaccination activists in australia  immunology experts say it is scientifically impossible for covid    vaccines to cause illness in unvaccinated people as they contain no live virus or any other infectious material that can pass from person to person  unsw infectious disease scientist associate professor holly seale told aap factcheck via email  the current covid    vaccines use mrna or non replicating virus  which are not contagious and cannot be transmitted to non vaccinated people  associate professor menno van zelm from monash universitys department of immunology and pathology agreed  telling aap factcheck that there are no credible reports that vaccinated people can make other people ill  for one  covid    vaccines do not contain the virus nor any other infectious agent that is contagious  dr van zelm said in an email  yes  the vaccine activates the immune system and can make the recipient feel unwell for    hours  but this does not affect bystanders  the claim that covid    vaccines can spread from person to person seems to be based on misconception or misinformation about recipients ability to shed vaccine particles  vaccine shedding is technically possible when vaccine uses weakened version of the live virus  although this is extremely rare  however  covid    vaccines do not use live virus  meaning recipients cannot shed any virus particles  dr seale told aap factcheck some oral vaccines used live versions of weakened viruses that could be transmitted  although they were still too weak to cause illness  in limited circumstances  live weakened vaccine viruses can be passed to people who have not been vaccinated  she said  this relates to the use of the oral influenza vaccine and the oral poliovirus vaccine  firstly  it is important to remember that the virus that is identifiable  either in the childs nasal secretions or faeces  is so weak that it cannot cause disease  secondly  neither of these vaccines are available for use in australia  two covid    vaccines have been approved for use in australia  the pfizer biontech vaccine and the oxford astrazeneca vaccine  the pfizer variant is messenger rna  mrna  vaccine  new type of vaccine that uses genetic code called rna to spark the production of coronavirus spike protein  the astrazeneca product is viral vector vaccine which uses harmless  weakened animal virus to instruct our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein  both vaccines equip the immune system to recognise and attack the virus if it ever enters the body  the australian department of health website confirms that those vaccines can sometimes cause side effects for recipients  such as fever and fatigue  but states  none of the approved vaccines in australia contain the live virus  this means they cannot give you covid     the post also falsely describes covid    vaccines as experimental gene therapy  similar claim was previously debunked by aap factcheck  baseless claims about so called vaccine shedding have been debunked many times  including here  here and here  professor andrew pollard  director of the oxford vaccine group at the university of oxford  told full fact  i cant think of any biologically plausible mechanism for shedding of components of any of the licensed covid    vaccines after immunisation  cÃ©line gounder  an infectious disease specialist who served as covid    advisor on president bidens transition advisory team  told the new york times that vaccinated people cant shed anything because theres nothing to be shedding  the posts claim that covid    vaccines can somehow cause unvaccinated women to suffer heavy menstruation  bleeding or miscarriages has been disproven multiple times  including here  here and here  each of the debunks make the same point that covid    vaccines contain no live virus or other contagious elements  so they cannot possibly affect anybody other than the recipient  american canadian gynaecologist and new york times columnist jennifer gunter published blog post on april    addressing new lie circulating about the covid    vaccine that people who get the vaccine can affect the menstrual cycle or fertility of others  let me be very clear  the covid    vaccines cannot affect anyone by proxy  anyone telling you otherwise wishes you harm  dr gunter wrote  there is also no evidence that covid    vaccines affect fertility or pregnancy among recipients  although the us centers for disease control and prevention says there is limited data about the safety of the vaccines when taken by women who are pregnant or breastfeeding  false claims that covid    vaccines cause sterility have previously been covered by aap factcheck here  michelle wise from the university of aucklands department of obstetrics and gynaecology wrote in recent article for the conversation that more research is needed to establish whether covid    vaccines affect the periods of vaccine recipients  but she added that there was no need for people to be concerned  as for the claim that pets have died when touched by someone who got the covid jab  monash universitys dr van zelm and unsws dr seale both told aap factcheck this is simply not possible for the same reason that vaccines cannot harm unvaccinated humans  vaccinated people are not contagious  so there is no reason to think that they can affect other people or animals merely by the fact that they have had the vaccine  dr van zelm said  covid    vaccines cannot cause illness in unvaccinated people or animals as none of the treatments contain any live virus or other transmissible elements  vaccine experts have confirmed

after weathering the first wave of the pandemic  india is now dealing withÂ anotherÂ widespread outbreak of the coronavirusÂ that has yielded overcrowdedÂ crematoriums  short supply of medicalÂ oxygenÂ and understaffed hospitals Â  indiaÂ has nearly    million cases of the coronavirus and has had Â nearly         deaths  according toÂ data from johns hopkins university  Â on may    itÂ set daily global case recordÂ with more than         new cases Â  as researchers and health officials attemptÂ to identifyÂ what s behind the covid   Â surge in india Â some users have taken to social media to suggestÂ vaccines are to blame   india was doing just fine until they started mass vaccinating   reads screen grab of an april    tweetÂ that wasÂ shared to instagram on may  Â and facebookÂ on may   Â  accompanying the text is graphic purportedly showing theÂ number of covid    vaccination doses administeredÂ per     people in indiaÂ compared with the number of deathsÂ in the countryÂ per million people  the chart has timeline from jan           Â to april          Â and claimsÂ india s second wave started on jan      when the country launchedÂ its vaccination drive against covid     in direct message  the instagram user said the data is  cited  and claimed the post  did not make statement that one led to another   the facebook user did not return request for comment  the person who posted the original tweet  suneil jain  similarly told usa today that he was simply presenting data for people to  interpret as they wish   of course  presenting those datasets together with text pointing out the overlap in timing leaves readers with clear impression the two are connected  and that s false  fact check  no evidence that   year old died after getting pfizer covid    vaccine the image cites our world in data for the numbers  however Â lucas rodÃ©s guirao  aÂ senior data analystÂ with the organization Â said the  image showing both metrics  deaths and vaccinations  did not come from us  Â   we should make clear that the inference that vaccinations are in any way driving covid deaths does not come from us   he said via email   the data on vaccinations and deaths across countries does not support this conclusion   while the covid    outbreakÂ in india followed the jan     rollout of two vaccines covishield  developed by astrazeneca with oxford university  and covaxin  by indian firm bharat biotech   the two areÂ not associated with each other  government data shows india has administered about    Â million doses total Â with around   Â million people receiving both doses Â that s just little over    of the country s population of     billion  india sÂ second wave of covid   Â startedÂ in february  when it reported an average of        infections day   it s common fallacy that correlation implies causation   saidÂ sumit chanda  director of the immunity and pathogens program at sanford burnham prebys medical discovery institute Â  there s actually an inverse correlation between those people who got the vaccine and those people are getting sick   in others words  people who got the vaccine are getting infected less often  not more  some users in the comments claim those who have been vaccinated against covid    in india are  shedding  the virus and infecting others  however  that claim has been previously debunked Â chanda reiterated that vaccine shedding claims are  completely false  Â  fact check  covid    vaccinated people dont shed viral particles from the vaccine covishield has an efficacy of about      and covaxin showed clinical efficacy ofÂ    Â from interim dataÂ in its phase   trials  in march  government panelÂ in india found deaths occurring after injection of the two vaccines were connected by timing only  with no causal relationship  according to theÂ economic times Â  fact check  misleading meme suggests deaths following covid    vaccination are due to vaccine immunologistÂ robert quigley  senior vice president and global medical director at international sos  health risk mitigation firm  also saidÂ the covid    outbreak in india has  nothing to do with the vaccine  Â  researchers and experts sayÂ a varietyÂ of forces caused the resurgence of covid    in india  lack of preparedness  emergingÂ variants of the virus  eased lockdowns and large gatherings Â   i think lot of people wereÂ letting their guard down in india thinking that the worst is behind us Â and government policiesÂ equally promoted that stance   chanda said  covid    cases in india began to dip aroundÂ september and followed that trendÂ for    consecutive weeks  and theÂ government did not pause hindu religious festivals or elections  Â a report in the lancet medical journal saysÂ those mass gatherings and lack of protective measures allowed the virus to spread freely Â  chanda said these factors created  perfect storm  for delayed second wave in india  which he says  was not unpredictable  Â he added people are dying in india not dying from vaccines  butÂ due to covid    symptoms  lack of oxygen andÂ  the near collapse of the health care system  Â  quigley also pointed to the country sÂ underfunded health care system  perÂ reuters Â india spends    of gross domestic product on health  which is lower than most major economies Â   their health care infrastructure is fragile on good day   quigley said   it s clearly overwhelmed with all these cases  aÂ lot of people are not in the upper echelons of society  so they don t have good health care to begin with   new strain of the sars cov   coronavirus calledÂ b      Â Â a  double mutant  having two mutations on the virus spike  is likely another contributing factor  however Â more research is neededÂ on that point  quigley said Â  fact check  no  the covid    vaccines won t give you genital herpes india s national centre for disease controlÂ recently said samples containing b       have been found in several states with high case numbers  but thatÂ it has not been able to fully establish correlation  according to the indian express Â  chart claiming india s second wave of covid    casesÂ is connected to its vaccination drive is false  based on our research  our world in data  which is referenced as theÂ source for the claim  said the metrics did not come from it and there is no researchÂ supporting that vaccines are causingÂ covid    deaths  experts agree that an overwhelmed health care system  new variants  and large mass gatherings without restrictions led to surge in covid    cases and fatalities  cases were  predictably  less common in people who had received the vaccine,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
lateral flow tests could cause cancer or damage dna because the swabs used to collect sample from the user are sterilised with ethylene oxide  overexposure to ethylene oxide itself can cause health problems such as cancer  but there is no suggestion that using something that has been sterilised by ethylene oxide is harmful  it is routinely used to sterilise medical equipment  ivermectin can cure covid    in    hours  study looking at ivermectins impact on the sars cov   virus in cells in the lab found it dramatically reduced the amount of viral rna in cells within    hours  which doesnt mean it can do the same in people  both the department of health and social care and the who have said there is not sufficient evidence to prove the efficacy of ivermectin as cure for covid     and its use remains controversial  you might not be able to have children if you have the covid    vaccine  there is no evidence that any covid    vaccines can impact fertility  the nhs is currently advising that

claims that lateral flow tests could cause cancer or damage dna because the swabs used to collect sample from the user are sterilised with ethylene oxide Â  we have fact checked claims that ethylene oxide  colourless gas used to sterilise medical equipment worldwide  makes lateral flow tests unsafe before Â  overexposure to ethylene oxide itself can cause health problems such as cancer  but there is no suggestion that using something that has been sterilised by ethylene oxide will be harmful  the uk regulator  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra   has previously confirmed to full fact that ethylene oxide is highly controlled and safe method of sterilisation  which is assessed and evaluated throughout the sterilisation process to ensure it meets agreed safety standards Â  the second part of the video  recorded by different person  repeats concerns about ethylene oxide and goes on to question why the drug ivermectin is not being used instead of covid    vaccines Â  the video features clip from news report  broadcast by one america news network  oann  sometimes presented as oan  which claims that dose of ivermectin could kill covid in less than    hours Â  this report appears to reference study published in june       it found that the drug dramatically reduced the amount of genetic information from the virus in cells in the laboratory within    hours Â  the study did not examine the impact ivermectin had on humans with covid     the researchers said at the time that ivermectin therefore warrants further investigation for possible benefits in humans Â  we have written about ivermectin  an anti parasite medication  and its controversial position in the context of covid    before  the department of health and social care has previously confirmed to full fact that based on the data currently available  it did not believe that there was sufficient evidence to prove that ivermectin is safe and effective treatment for covid     meanwhile  all three covid    vaccines currently in use in the uk are effective at significantly reducing the risk of contracting symptomatic covid     as we have previously reported Â  as we have written before there is no evidence that mrna vaccines such as the pfizer biontech and moderna covid    vaccines can impact fertility Â  claims about links between the vaccines and infertility have persisted throughout the vaccine rollout  there is no evidence that nanoparticles in covid    vaccines affect fertility and no evidence the pfizer biontech vaccine interferes with placenta formation or womens fertility in general Â  dr edward morris  president at the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists  said in january that there is no biologically plausible mechanism by which current vaccines would cause any impact on women s fertility  current nhs advice states that it is preferable to have either the pfizer biontech or moderna vaccines if you are currently pregnant  as they ve been more widely used during pregnancy in other countries and have not caused any safety issues  if pregnant person has already had one dose of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine and observed no

writer and talk show host  michigan governor gretchen whitmer  has made her entire state hostage to being vaccinated  get the jab or suffer gunpoint enforced lockdowns  they wont end until     of the states adults surrender to being injected  on may    russian state broadcaster rt ran an op ed by jani allan  writer and talk show host  strongly objecting to the mass vaccination drive against covid     which has killed an estimated     million people globally  the piece is one of many featured on rt questioning the safety of western vaccines and other pandemic prevention measures  often in hyperbolic terms  allan claims she is not engaging in an anti vaccine rant  but sober discussion on civil liberties  she compares ongoing vaccination efforts to fascism  falsely claims enforced mask wearing is doing irreparable harm to children  accuses pediatrician of wanting the  united nations to establish shock troops to hunt down and eliminate anti vaxxers  and questions whether those who cannot provide proof of vaccination will suffer similar fate to jews in nazi germany  being forced to endure covid apartheid  allan claims michigan gov  gretchen whitmer has made her entire state hostage to being vaccinated  get the jab or suffer gunpoint enforced lockdowns  they wont end until     of the states adults surrender to being injected  this is fascistic coercion that violates restrictions against medical experiments  violates fundamental human rights and the requirement for informed consent  allan writes   surely such tactics should never be deployed or tolerated in free society  allan continues  after which she refers to nazi germanys nuremberg race laws  allans characterizations of covid    vaccination efforts in michigan and other claims of gross rights violations related to inoculation efforts are blatantly false  as experts told agence france presse  using covid    vaccination is perfectly compatible with the nuremberg code  which is only intended to halt coerced medical experimentation  the claim made by allan and other opponents of covid    vaccination that administering it amounts to experimentation often reflects faulty understanding of how emergency use authorization  eua  works in the united states  eua permits the distribution of vaccines prior to u s  food and drug administration  fda  approval  medical experts note that eua does not affect how vaccines are developed or clinical studies into potential side effects  rather  it streamlines bureaucracy and production  those covid    vaccines that have received eua in the u s  have all completed phase   trials  in which the vaccines were administered to tens of thousands of people in randomized  controlled studies involving broad demographic groups  the fda said  as for the claim that vaccines require informed consent  meaning recipient must agree to get the vaccine and understands the potential benefits and consequences   the u s  centers for disease control and prevention says  there is no federal requirement for informed consent relating to immunization  with vaccines administered on state by state basis at number of venues  determining how informed each individual is prior to vaccination is near impossible  individuals do  however  complete vaccine screening and consent form prior to inoculation  while states have the legal and constitutional authority to mandate inoculation  covid    vaccination remains completely voluntary throughout the u s  meantime  michigans gov  whitmer  democrat  has long been lightning rod for controversy due to her stringent measures to tackle the covid    pandemic and use of emergency powers to enact them  michigan authorities have been targeted by lawsuits challenging those pandemic related measures  other opponents of whitmer took it much further  in october          members of right wing paramilitary group were arrested for allegedly conspiring to kidnap her and overthrow the michigan government in response to covid    related restrictions  contrary to allan  the legal and political processes surrounding whitmers covid    policies have been typically democratic  not fascistic  republican led lawsuits even culminated in michigan supreme court ruling that whitmer could not use the emergency powers of governor act to tackle the pandemic  including stay at home orders  in april  whitmer said no new covid    lockdown measures would be implemented despite spike in cases  stating she did not have the exact same tools because of those legal challenges and rulings  measures that include mask requirements and limits on gatherings issued by michigans department of health and human services were not affected by the court ruling  the detroit free press reported  some of those restrictions were later lifted  with whitmer announcing in january that bars and restaurants could reopen at limited capacity  as of this writing  food service establishments  indoor and outdoor gatherings  cosmetology and barber services  entertainment venues  movie theaters  casinos  etc    gym and exercise studios  pools  funeral parlors and offices are open or permitted with restrictions  schools  places of worship  parks  childcare facilities and doctors offices are open without restrictions  some business owners continue to challenge the legality of those measures  still  allans claim that michigan residents are being compelled to get vaccinated under the threat of gunpoint enforced lockdowns is gross mischaracterization of whitmers staggered reopening strategy   in april  whitmer released plan linking rising levels of vaccination to loosening of covid    related restrictions  with the goal of vaccinating     of the population aged    or older  michigan republicans have welcomed that approach  although some have argued that metrics other than vaccination  like lowered infection rates  should be considered  on may     whitmer announced the first vaccine milestone had been reached  with     of michiganders having received at least one covid    vaccine dose  the vaccine milestones are based on voluntary participation  whitmer has never signaled any intention to make

an instagram post claims official uk government modelling predicted up to    per cent of people vaccinated against covid    will die during third wave of the virus  the april    post includes screenshot of an article  the text of which states  according to projections by uks top modelling agency the thrid  sic  wave of covid    spike will hospitalize and kill    to     of those people who took both the vaccine doses  the paper suggests that the resurgence in both hospitalisations and deaths will dominated  sic  by those who have received two doses of the vaccine  comprising around     and     of the wave respectively  at the time of writing  the post had over      reactions and     comments  it was posted to the instagram account of australian jamie mcintyre  who has more than        followers  the account features range of memes and other content critical of vaccines or detailing various covid    conspiracy theories  for example here and here   the article is from the great game india website  which purports to be journal on geopolitics and international relations  it publishes articles critical of covid    vaccines and has been fact checked previously for spreading other misinformation  including baseless claims that the coronavirus was stolen bioweapon  the claim that uk government modelling predicted up to    per cent of those vaccinated against covid    would die or be hospitalised during future outbreak is false and based on misreading or misrepresentation of an official report  the march    report does not say that third wave of covid    cases would kill between    and    per cent of people who were vaccinated  as claimed in the post and article  it examines what could happen as covid    related restrictions in england are relaxed under the governments roadmap out of lockdown  it finds  based on modelling  that an increase in covid    related hospitalisations and deaths is likely after restrictions are relaxed  the report includes an estimate that    per cent of those hospitalisations and    per cent of deaths would be among people who had received two doses of the vaccine  this was due to the high vaccination rate among the most at risk age groups  and the fact that for small proportion of that at risk contingent the vaccine will not be effective protection against serious illness or death  the document also clearly states that there would be many more deaths and hospitalisations if fewer people were vaccinated  the report was produced by the scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling  operational sub group  spi m o   which advises the uk government  it was released as the government was preparing to move to step two in the roadmap  involving the reopening of hospitality businesses and non essential retail  later stages are scheduled for no earlier than may    and june     the document said it was highly likely there will be another resurgence in hospitalisations and deaths after relaxing restrictions  but the scale  shape  and timing of any resurgence is highly uncertain  page     this was based on modelling from the university of warwick  the imperial college of london and the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine  the central scenario in the modelling was that more than    per cent of all adults would be vaccinated by june     page     under this scenario  receiving two doses of the pfizer vaccine was estimated to reduce the risk of death or hospitalisation by between    and    per cent  while two doses of the astrazeneca vaccine were expected to reduce the risk of death or hospitalisation by    to    per cent  page     the report said while modelling predicted the number of covid    cases in the uk was likely to increase as restrictions eased  high vaccination rates and the efficacy of the vaccine meant that moving to step two in the roadmap leads to only relatively modest increase in hospital admissions and deaths  page     it said implementing all four steps of the roadmap at the earliest possible date would result in third wave of covid    infections  peaking around july august  but that the wave would be smaller than previous outbreaks  page   and figure    page      the report added that this resurgence was result of some people  mostly children  being ineligible for vaccination  others choosing not to receive the vaccine  and others being vaccinated but not perfectly protected  including those who have only received one dose  rather than two   the majority of expected hospitalisations and deaths were in those who had been vaccinated  however the document said this was result of the high vaccination rate among those most at risk from contracting covid    and the fact the vaccines were not     per cent effective  the resurgence in both hospitalisations and deaths is dominated by those that have received two doses of the vaccine  comprising around    per cent and    per cent of the wave respectively  this can be attributed to the high levels of uptake in the most at risk age groups  such that immunisation failures account for more serious illness than unvaccinated individuals  the report states  page      the report reiterates later that the reason the majority of projected Â hospitalisations and deaths occur in those who have been vaccinated is because vaccination rates are predicted to reach    per cent in those over     the cohort considered most vulnerable to the virus  there are therefore    of over    year olds who have not been vaccinated  and     x            of over    year olds who are vaccinated but  nevertheless  not protected against death  this is not the result of vaccines being ineffective  merely uptake being so high  the report states  page      it says the number of deaths and hospitalisations expected in third wave was lower than in previous models because the uptake of vaccines was assumed to be higher in the most recent models  page      mr mcintyre  who shared the claim  also runs website which republishes range of conspiracy theories and misinformation  including that covid    vaccines are part of genocide agenda and suggestions celebrities take adrenochrome made from terrorised childrens blood  alongside promotions for bitcoin sponsorship opportunities  in       he was banned from being company director or offering financial services for decade for running unregistered investment schemes  uk government model did not predict that up to    per cent of those vaccinated against covid    will die in third wave of the virus  in fact  the modelling showed higher vaccination rates are expected to significantly reduce the number of deaths and hospitalisations in future outbreak  instead  the report predicts    per cent of deaths in third uk coronavirus surge would be among people who have received two doses of covid    vaccine  this was because the vaccines do not offer perfect protection from serious illness or death for every recipient  and high proportion of vaccine recipients are in the most vulnerable age group  false  content that has no basis in fact  aap factcheck is an accredited member of the international fact checking network  to

theres do not resuscitate across the uk on the elderly  on the disabled  guidance from regulatory bodies explicitly says that do not resuscitate orders should not use blanket approach      the preliminary report from care quality commission investigation into the use of dnacprs during the covid    pandemic found examples of unacceptable and inappropriate dnacprs being made at the start of the pandemic  but stated that there was no evidence to suggest it continued as widespread problem  this is an experimental injection  it hasnt had phase three trials completed  analyses of data from phase three trials for all three covid    vaccines authorised for use in the uk have been published in peer reviewed studies in medical journals  covid    vaccines have caused thousands upon thousands of life changing adverse reactions  reports of possible events that have occurred around the time of vaccination are made to the mhras yellow card scheme  just because theyve been reported does not mean that they have been proven to be caused by the vaccine  the government knew before the covid    vaccines roll out that they would kill and maim and issued tender for surveillance system to monitor deaths  this may refer to either an artificial intelligence contract the government awarded to monitor adverse drug events or the yellow card scheme which was established in           in either case both are intended to ensure drug safety  and reports of adverse events are not necessarily linked to the covid    vaccines  the covid    pandemic was planned and was facilitated by the use of false positive pcr tests  we have repeatedly debunked the conspiracy that the pandemic was planned operation and pcr tests have high rate of accuracy  video shared on facebook featuring influencers kate shemirani and kevin corbett makes number of false claims and has been viewed thousands of times Â  the clip contains many claims that are not backed up by evidence  or that dont provide the full context Â  this article does not discuss every claim made in the video  but here is look at several of them Â  the regulatory bodies for doctors and nurses  the general medical council and the nursing and midwifery council  say that do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation orders  dnacprs  should be made on patient by patient basis  based on the balance of risks and benefits  and consider an individuals own views and values  they should be discussed with the individual if they have capacity  and discussed with their legal proxy with appropriate authority  or closest person to them  if they do not Â  there are times when cardiopulmonary resuscitation  cpr  may not be clinically appropriate  for example  when there is very little chance of successfully restarting someones breathing or heartbeat or restoring circulation  or because it is against an individuals wishes  if this is the case  and there is time in advance  dnacpr may be put in place Â  during the covid    pandemic  nhs leadership and regulatory bodies including the royal college of general practitioners  the british medical association  the care provider alliance  the care quality commission  cqc   the royal college of nursing and the nursing and midwifery council issued statements reasserting the importance of individualised decisions around resuscitation  and the need to communicate appropriately with patients and their families or representatives Â  there were reported cases and concerns that during the covid    pandemic some dnacprs were inappropriately placed and conducted  or poorly communicated  concerns were raised particularly around examples involving people with disabilities and people living in care homes Â  there has been cqc investigation into this and its interim report found that there is evidence of unacceptable and inappropriate dnacprs being made at the start of the pandemic  it added that it was looking into the scale of this  and cases where inappropriate dnacprs may remain in place but also added there had been quick response to highlight the issue and that there was no evidence to suggest it had continued as widespread problem  we have written about similar claims referring to the covid    vaccines before Â  analyses of the data on safety and efficacy from phase three trials for all of the covid    vaccines  pfizer biontech  oxford astrazeneca and moderna  which have been given temporary authorisation in the uk have been published in peer reviewed articles in medical journals such as the lancet and the new england journal of medicine Â  data on the long term protection and safety of the vaccines will continue to be collected over the coming years  and for this reason the completion dates for the trials are set in the future  phase three trials are large trials in thousands of people to determine vaccine safety and efficacy  and are the last stage before vaccine is put forward to healthcare agencies for authorisation and licensing Â  the medicines and healthcare products regulation authority  mhra   which approved the vaccines in the uk and conducts ongoing routine safety monitoring  has said that following widespread use of these vaccines across the uk  the vast majority of suspected adverse reaction reports so far confirm the safety profile seen in clinical trials Â  it added  the expected benefits of the vaccines in preventing covid    and serious complications associated with covid    far outweigh any currently known side effects  we have written about this before Â  the uks yellow card scheme collects and monitors safety concerns involving medicines and medical devices such as suspected or potential side effects  this relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public  this system is monitored by the mhra  the yellow card scheme was established in      following the thalidomide birth defect scandal  its aim is to detect adverse effects of all medicines  not just those related to covid    Â  in the uk  as of    april       there have been        yellow cards reported for the pfizer biontech vaccine          reported for the oxford university astrazeneca vaccine      for the moderna vaccine and     with an unspecified vaccine brand  as explained by the mhra the nature of yellow card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects  some events may have happened anyway  regardless of vaccination  this is particularly the case when millions of people are vaccinated  and especially when most vaccines are being given to the most elderly people and people who have underlying illness Â  therefore  it is important to remember that an adverse event reported to the yellow card scheme may have happened for many other reasons  and not as result of the vaccine Â  on   april       the mhra issued statement advising on possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets  as precaution  because of the balance of risks from covid    for young people  the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation now advise that people under the age of    in the uk should be offered an alternative covid    vaccine Â  they have said that  adverse events following the oxford astrazeneca vaccine are extremely rare and  for the vast majority of people  the benefits of preventing serious illness and death far outweigh any risks  Â Â  its not entirely clear what surveillance systems kevin corbett is referring to  but it may be the yellow card scheme described above  its also not clear what tender is being referred to either  using the contracts finder tender search engine  there are many small and large government contracts that aim to determine the impact of covid     its possible that he was referring to contract to monitor covid    adverse drug reactions which the mhra awarded last year  the contract award notice described this as  an artificial intelligence  ai  software tool to process the expected high volume of covid    vaccine adverse drug reaction  adrs  and ensure that no details from the adrs reaction text are missed  it did not mention an expected high volume of deaths as claimed  this is part of standard monitoring processes  and as we ve written before  reported adverse reactions are not necessarily the same as side effects and may be unrelated to the vaccine Â  we have already debunked claims that governments and industry conspired to plan the coronavirus pandemic  the theory was popularised by an online video called plandemic which perpetuated number of mistruths about covid     as we have written before  the exact false positive rate for pcr testing is extremely small with the accuracy of positive tests very close to      according to the office for national statistics  Â  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read

include important context  for example  there is not blanket dnacpr for elderly people and the disabled across the uk  the covid    vaccines have had phase three trial data published  the covid

the nhs was not overwhelmed during covid     this is somewhat subjective but there is lots of evidence indicating nhs trusts were under severe pressure during the peaks of covid     all covid    vaccines are experimental  we have repeatedly shown that covid    vaccines are not experimental  they have been through sufficient safety and efficacy trials  south africa has not vaccinated its elderly due to lack of data  there is no evidence to suggest this is the case  at least with regard to data about the vaccines  south africa is due to start vaccinating the elderly this month  people who die within    days of positive covid    test have covid put on their death certificate automatically  false  medical professionals filling out death certificates are not required to note covid    test result if they dont think it was relevant to the cause of death  lockdown and the tier systems are deadlier than covid     there is no evidence to suggest this is true  official estimates suggest that the lockdown in the spring of      saved many thousands of lives  post on facebook shows transcript of letter sent to dr june raine cbe  ceo of the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra   this was first posted on    february but has been regularly circulated since and shared more than     times Â  there are many misleading claims in this post  some of which are similar to other claims we have recently fact checked Â  we dont aim to fact check all of them  but here are some of the key claims and why they are misleading  whether hospitals were overwhelmed during the covid    pandemic is subjective judgement but  many hospitals have declared critical incidents during the covid    crisis  experienced severe bed pressures  seen staff absence increase through stress and sickness  suffered staff deaths from covid    and had to turn patients away Â  total hospital capacity was reduced during the nhss response to covid     it was prioritised for covid    patients  cancer care and urgent elective procedures  details of these arrangements are available via the nhs england website  as we have repeatedly said  covid    vaccines are not experimental and have passed required clinical trials  the nuremberg code says that subjects voluntary consent is essential in medical experiments  but the covid    vaccines are not experimental Â  in any case  patients consent is required to administer vaccines  including the covid vaccines  this is outlined in public health englands      green book on immunisation  although there are exceptions where informed consent cannot be provided  or the patient is too young to do so  vaccination always requires consent of some sort  the reference to phase four trials is odd  phase four studies are surveillance studies which always happen after vaccine has been rolled out to the publicso of course new vaccine is not going to have passed any phase four studies  that doesnt make it experimental  there is no evidence that south africa delayed vaccination of its     or elderly population due to lack of data about vaccines Â  epidemiologists suggested difficulty gathering statistics on the spread of covid    may have delayed vaccine rollout in countries across africa  but thats not to say vaccinations have been delayed due to concerns with vaccines  south africa started its vaccination programme with healthcare workers and has recently started registering the elderly for vaccinations starting this month  south africa did pause the rollout of the johnson and johnson vaccine to assess the risk of blood clots following single dose shot  but its health regulator later recommended its resumption  its false to claim that every person who dies within    days of positive covid    test has covid put on their death certificate  death certificates are filled out by medical professionals who may take covid    test results into account  but are not required to include covid as cause of death if it isnt relevant to the death of someone who has tested positive Â  there is measure of deaths within    days of positive covid    test result  but this does not come from death certificate data Â  we have debunked the idea that there is double standard in the way that deaths within    days of positive result and    days following vaccination is reported  while the measure of deaths within    days of positive covid    test result will capture some people who died of something unrelated to covid     it will also not include those who died of covid    but werent tested  or those who died more than    days after the test  the    day cut off was introduced to increase the accuracy determining covid    as cause of death Â  the number of people dying within    days of positive covid    test is similar to the number of people with covid    on their death certificate  suggesting it is good proxy for the number of genuine covid    deaths Â  by contrast  while some deaths may have been linked to the vaccine  especially the    blood clot deaths following an astrazeneca vaccine  many deaths are likely to have occurred within    days of vaccination simply due to the fact that many millions of vaccines have been administered to the elderly Â Â  there is very little evidence to suggest that the introduction of lockdown or tier system is deadlier than exposing the public to covid    without such system  as we have said before  detailed government estimate suggests that locking down in the spring did save many thousands of lives  compared with doing nothing  largely because it prevented the health service being overwhelmed  as for vaccines  there have been over       reports of death following vaccination in the uk  but theres no certainty that any of them were linked to vaccination Â  of these     were caused by blood clots  which the mhra has said is possibly linked to the astrazeneca vaccine Â  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos

social media post claims there is justification for calling covid    vaccines poison because the word appears in australian legislation authorising defence paramedics and nurses to administer the

post had been viewed more than        times and shared more than     times  similar claims have been shared on instagram here and here by other australian users  the post provides screenshot of real state government authorisation  however it ignores the fact that every medicine and vaccine distributed in australia  alongside thousands of other chemicals  are classified under unifying federal legislation known as the poisons standard  the post seeks to portray the use of the term poison as an indicator that the covid    vaccine will have toxic or harmful effect  this is misleading  the poisons standards role is to establish uniform national guideline for how both medicines and poisons are scheduled  labelled and packaged  the federal health departments introduction to the poisons standard document states at the onset  any substance  ingredient  can be poison and cause harm if used incorrectly or taken at the wrong dose   page    substances covered by the poisons standard are categorised in    schedules based on their risk of harm to people  and how accessible they are to the public  covid    vaccines are classified by the therapeutic goods administration  tga  under schedule four  which covers prescription only human and animal medicines  see here and here   australia has provisionally approved two covid    vaccines for use  the astrazeneca and pfizer vaccines  the tga decided the vaccines meet the high safety  efficacy and quality standards required for use in australia despite extremely rare cases of potentially fatal blood clotting adverse reaction to the astrazeneca vaccine  the legislation featured in the post refers to the wa chief health officers decision  under the states public health act  page           to authorise australian defence force paramedics and medical technicians to supply or administer covid    vaccines to the wa population from march    in western australia  the federal poisons standard categories are reflected in the states medicines and poisons act       tga spokeswoman told aap factcheck in an email that  under the law  all medicines are called poisons within the poisons standard  document search within the standard shows paracetamol  for example  is listed in schedule two while schedule four includes everything from the cholera vaccine to antidepressants as well as the covid    treatments  in the current version of the poisons standard  the word poison does not appear in the definitions for schedules two to four  which refer to medicines  while poison and dangerous poison appear in schedules six and seven respectively  medicines are mostly included in schedules two  three  four and eight of the poisons standard  with progression through these schedules signifying increasingly restrictive regulatory controls  the tga spokeswoman said  noting that all human vaccines were included in schedule four  substances in the poisons standard are not solely classified based on how toxic they are  categorisation is based on series of factors  including purpose of use  potential for abuse  how safe substance is in use  the need for the substance and toxicity  spokesperson for wa health told aap factcheck in an email that medicines are subset of poisons as they are generally safe only at certain doses  therefore  they  are regulated accordingly  the post correctly identifies that the term poison is used in an official western australian authorisation to describe covid    vaccines  however  it and other posts misleadingly draw on this information to imply the vaccines are toxic  in fact  all medicines  including over the counter treatments  are classified under australias unifying medicine and poisons categorisation system  the poisons standard  this does not mean vaccines or other

the good news in the fight against the coronavirus  new cases continue to decline  according the latest data from the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  the bad news  so are daily vaccinations  which peaked in mid april Â  experts say part of the deceleration may correlate with the timing of theÂ johnson   johnson vaccine pause announced april   Â but lifted april     part of it may also be due to lingering fears surrounding covid    vaccines  one such recent claim connects the shot withÂ herpes infection Â   herpes infection could be rare side effect of the covid    vaccine  according to new study   claims may  Â instagram post from the raging patriot  an account that advertises itself as  real news by real patriots   these purported findings have been disseminated widely on social media and refer to an israeli study published in april in the journal rheumatology  usa today has reached out to the raging patriot for comment Â  citing scientific report might sound convincing and concerning Â especially since many people would associate herpes with the sexually transmitted disease   no honey i did not have sex with anyone  it was that damn vaccine that gave me the herpes   commentedÂ one instagram user on the post Â  but that s not the kind of herpes referenced here  and that s not exactly what the study found  the israeli study was actually evaluating whether mrna vaccines  such as pfizer biontech and moderna s shots  are safe for people with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseasesÂ   group of conditions that affect the body s joints  bones  muscles and connective tissue Â since clinical trials have excluded this specific patient group  the observational study conducted at the tel aviv medical center and carmel medical center in haifa monitored    Â people with aiird and    controls for six weeks after they received pfizer s covid    vaccine  six women between the ages of    andÂ    with stable rheumatic diseases developed herpes zoster infection  five cases occurred after the first dose and one after the second Â Â  with the exception of one woman getting hzÂ affecting the eyes  all five cases were mild and resolved after antiviral treatment Â   we haven t seen any additional cases so far   dr  victoria furer  lead author of the report and rheumatologist at the tel aviv medical center  told medpage today Â  hz is caused by the varicella zoster virus  part of the same family of viruses that causeÂ cold sores and genital herpes  but hzÂ doesn t itself cause these conditions  in children  hz infections leads to chickenpox  common but highly contagious and transmissible illness characterized by itchy  blisterlike rashes  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention Â because the virus lies dormant within the nervous system after recovery  it can reactivate years later  as withÂ the six women  who all had past history of hz infection Â this reactivationÂ leadsÂ to shingles  condition also marked by painful rashes that can present anywhere on the body  though usually appearingÂ as stripe around the torso  according to the mayo clinic  there have been reports in the past of vaccines causing shingles  dr  amesh adalja of johns hopkins university told health  so the phenomenon is not unheard of  but it s important to note theÂ authors of the israeli reportÂ emphasize the study wasn t structured to determine whetherÂ there was an actual relationship between the covid    vaccine and hz  as non vaccinated aiird patients were not included Â   our report does not establish any causality or definite link but draws the attention to possible association between mrnaÂ covid    vaccine and herpes zoster   furer told the associated press Â  in the u s  so far  there have been no increased reports of shingles after covid    vaccination  dr  william schaffner  of vanderbilt university  also told the associated press   we have been emphasizing the vaccination of older adults   schaffner said   that s the very population in which shingles is the most common  and so you would expect some cases of shingles to occur after vaccination   because it s going to occur anyway   almostÂ   in   people in the u s  will develop shingles in their lifetime  the risk increases the older person gets and even more so for anyone with weakened or compromised immune systems such as people with cancer  hiv or taking certain medications like steroids  but adalja said the overall risk of hz was low  especially for people with no autoimmune conditions  and any infections should resolveÂ after treatment with antiviral medications Â  we rate this claim missing context because without additional context it might be misleading  an israeli studyÂ found the covid    vaccine may be associated withÂ hz reactivation in some people with immune conditions Â but their findings do not prove definite link since the number of cases were small and the study was not designed to determineÂ causality  and the type of herpes being discussed here isÂ not the sexually transmitted disease many will associate with that term Â varicella zoster virus  which causes herpes zoster and chickenpox in children  does not cause genital herpes or cold sores  the infection is caused by reactivation of the virus in people who had the childhood disease,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

at inciting fear and telling viewers that they should be terrified of covid    vaccines  i believe theyre going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you  seriously  i can see no sensible interpretation other than serious attempt at mass depopulation  said yeadon just after the    minute mark  this will provide the tools to do it and plausible deniability because theyll create another story about some sort of biological threat and youll line up and get your top up vaccines and  in few months  or year or so later youll die of some  you know  peculiar explicable syndrome and they wont be able to associate it with the top up vaccines  yeadon went on to tell viewers that everything your government has told you about this virus  everything you need to do to stay safe  is lie and added that lockdown and other preventative measures were aimed at totalitarian control  similar language was again used at the    minute mark  this system is being put in place using lies  and its been put in place for some purpose  and i believe that purpose is complete totalitarian control and i think the purpose of that is going to be mass depopulation  said yeadon  i cant think of single

going to lead to mass depopulation  deliberate execution potentially of billions of people  in may       executives at pfizer and biontech stated that individuals will likely need third dose within

source  anonymous  earthley    may      Â      review   social media posts calling the safety of the covid    vaccines into question commonly point to adverse events occurring after vaccination as evidence that the vaccine is responsible  as shown by this previous health feedback review  posts making such claims can be traced back to december       when the safety data from the initial clinical trials for the first covid    vaccine authorized by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  went public  vaccine skeptics also commonly point to proportion of people who died after receiving covid    vaccine as proof that the covid    vaccines are dangerous  for example  this meme  published on the facebook page earthley which sells herbal remedies  implied that getting covid    is safer than getting the vaccine  because the disease has       survival rate  while the vaccine had instead caused deaths  there are several instances of flawed reasoning that appear in the meme  one of which is the assumption that an event which followed another must have been caused by the earlier event  post hoc ergo propter hoc   while temporality is indeed necessary criterion for determining causality  it is by no means sufficient  necessity vs  sufficiency   in the case of vaccines  we also need to account for the fact that even unvaccinated people die for variety of reasons  as explained in this commentary in science translational medicine  were talking about treating very  very large populations  which means that youre going to see the usual run of mortality and morbidity that you see across large samples  specifically  if you take    million people and just wave your hand back and forth over their upper arms  in the next two months you would expect to see about       heart attacks  about       strokes  over       new diagnoses of cancer  and about        of that ten million will die  out of usual all causes mortality  no one would notice  thats how many people die and get sick anyway  but if you took those ten million people and gave them new vaccine instead  theres real danger that those heart attacks  cancer diagnoses  and deaths will be attributed to the vaccine  i mean  if you reach large enough population  you are literally going to have cases where someone gets the vaccine and drops dead the next day  just as they would have if they  didnt  get the vaccine   it could prove difficult to convince that persons friends and relatives of that lack of connection  though  post hoc ergo propter hoc is one of the most powerful fallacies of human logic  and were not going to get rid of it any time soon  therefore  it is necessary to compare the rate of the adverse event between the unvaccinated  baseline  and vaccinated groups  only when the rate is significantly higher in the vaccinated group do researchers have grounds to hypothesize that there is causal relationship  indeed  such comparisons are what health authorities and regulatory agencies do when adverse events are reported  for example  in the case of deaths  authorities didnt find that vaccinated people were more likely to die compared to unvaccinated people  with regards to deaths observed during initial clinical trials  page    of the fda briefing document for the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine stated  total of six    vaccine    placebo  of        enrolled participants         died during the reporting period from april           first participant  first visit  to november           cutoff date      all deaths represent events that occur in the general population of the age groups where they occurred  at similar rate   emphasis added  likewise for the moderna vaccine  the fda briefing document stated on page     as of december             deaths were reported    vaccine    placebo      these deaths represent events and rates that occur in the general population of individuals in these age groups   emphasis added  and following concerns over deaths in nursing home residents who had received the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  the global advisory committee on vaccine safety  gacvs  covid    vaccine safety subcommittee reviewed the reports of these deaths  the gacvs is scientific and clinical advisory body to who  which aims to provide reliable and independent scientific assessment of vaccine safety issues  the gacvs is not itself part of the who  on    january       the gacvs subcommittee released the following statement after completing the review  based on careful scientific review of the information made available  the subcommittee came to the following conclusions  the current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail  elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of bnt   b   reports are in line with the expected  all cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub population of frail  elderly individuals  and the available information does not confirm contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events   emphasis added  the bottom line is that scientists havent observed deaths occurring at higher rate in vaccinated people as compared to unvaccinated people  such an observation doesnt support the claim that covid    vaccines cause death  if this had been the case  we would have observed significantly higher mortality rate among vaccinated people  while the number of deaths reported in some news articles may seem concerning  it is important to place these figures in the context of the hundreds of millions of people who have received at least one dose of covid    vaccines  chance alone means that proportion among these hundreds of millions of vaccinated people will die for various reasons   figure    number of people worldwide who received at least one dose of any covid    vaccine  data and image from our world in data  the second instance of flawed reasoning in the meme is the suggestion that getting covid    is safer than the vaccine  since according to the meme  covid    has        survival rate  this is false and misleading on multiple counts  firstly  this implies that the only outcomes of covid    are death and complete recovery  we know that this isnt true  certain proportion of covid    survivors continue to suffer from persistent health problems  condition termed as long covid  some of these problems include difficulty breathing  cognitive deficits  joint and muscle pain     long covid is unpredictableit can affect the young as well as the elderly  even those with mild case of covid    can eventually develop long covid  the physical and mental toll of this condition is detrimental to persons quality of life  secondly  the post implied that there is single  universal survival rate for covid    which is         its unclear where this figure comes from  this is also misleading assertion  as explained in this health feedback review  the likelihood of dying from covid    varies great deal at the individual level  for example  well known factor associated with higher likelihood of dying from covid    is advanced age  in fact  the rise in covid    mortality rate occurs fairly early on  as this table on the u s  centers for disease control and prevention website shows  the numbers indicate that those aged    to    years old are    times more likely to die from covid    as compared to those aged between   to    years old  reference group   even young adults aged between    and    years old are already ten times more likely to die compared to the reference group  hence an increased likelihood of death from covid    isnt only seen in the elderly   figure    table comparing the risk of infection  hospitalization  and death by age group  published on this cdc webpage  all rates are relative to the   to    year old age category  screenshot taken on   may       in addition  the presence of certain health conditions  such as obesity and diabetes  as well as pregnancy  can increase persons likelihood of dying from covid     regardless of their age  thirdly  the risks associated with the vaccines are considerably smaller than those associated with the disease  take blood clotting events for example  while much concern has been raised over the increased prevalence of blood clots among people who received certain covid    vaccines  it is important to remember that covid    itself places person at risk of blood clots  preliminary findings from preprint  study that hasnt yet been peer reviewed by other scientists  estimated that the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosiswhich is the form of blood clots linked to the astrazeneca and johnson   johnson vaccinesassociated with covid    is between eight to ten times greater than that seen with the vaccines so far     as explained in this health feedback review  while person can also develop immunity to covid    by getting the infection  they run the risk of death and disability from the disease  the vaccines  on the other hand  allow person to develop immunity safely without running the same risks from the infection  and the evidence shows that the covid    vaccines are highly effective in protecting people from severe disease and death  simply put  it is safer to take the vaccine than not to  in summary  such posts oversimplify the complexities involved in drawing causal associations between vaccines and adverse events  downplay the consequences of getting covid     and discourage others from getting vaccinated by suggesting that vaccination is more risky than the disease  the overall effect is to mislead readers into thinking that getting covid    is preferable to getting the vaccine  when the evidence points to the contrary    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine   published

new data this week has found fully vaccinated adults    or older are     less likely to be hospitalized with covid    thanÂ their same aged peers  and     less likely if they have only receivedÂ one dose of mrna vaccine Â  these findings are the first large scale  real world results confirming pfizer and moderna s clinical trial dataÂ  and early reports from israel   said the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  which conducted the study Â Â Â  but vaccination  while highly effective  doesn t fully prevent coronavirus in some people  in the last few weeks  states across the u s  have reported cases of covid    infectionÂ among fully vaccinated people  also known as vaccine breakthrough infections  on social media  small number of deaths among this groupÂ has prompted comparisons to the covid    death rate among the general population Â   the death rate for fully vaccinated people is significantly higher than non vaccinated   claims instagram user ian smith in an april    post  smith s post includes screenshot of an april    tweetÂ claiming the cdc has reported        fully vaccinated americans have contracted covid        have died    as of april     the cdc has indeed reported total of       cases of covid    among fully vaccinated people and    deaths  fact check  coronavirus vaccines dont cause death  wont decimate worlds population but public health experts say calculatingÂ a death rate from those numbersÂ and comparing it to the general population is misleading Â  Â  usa today has reached out to smith for comment  to calculate an accurateÂ death rate Â the total number of positive covid    casesÂ among vaccinated individuals must be known  but that number isn t  said lisa miller  an epidemiologist and clinical professor at the colorado school of public health Â   we don t know that because we re not out there testing everyone  vaccinated    she told usa today  this gap in reporting is also acknowledged by the cdc  which relies on voluntary reporting from state health departments  not all real world breakthrough cases will be identified because of lack of testing  this is particularly true in instances of asymptomatic or mild illness  the agency said  emphasizing the data only serves as snapshot to help identify patterns  Â among vaccine breakthrough cases  without aÂ true number of asymptomatic and mild cases  this snapshot is skewedÂ towards severe covid    cases  said kristin nelson  an assistant professor of epidemiology at the emory university rollins school of public health  infected vaccinated people with severe symptoms are more likely to seek medical attention  beÂ hospitalized or die  these are the cases noticed and investigated by state health departments that later reach the cdc  both nelson and miller told usa today  its important to note thatÂ the cdc has said    of the    deaths among covid    infected  fully vaccinated people were asymptomatic or not related to covid     fact check  biden didn t say july   celebrations may be canceled if people don t get covid vaccinations the number of vaccine breakthrough infections is also quite small compared to the more thanÂ     million u s  adults who have been fully vaccinated as of april    Â Â  the most obvious reason to avoid comparing the vaccinated and unvaccinated death rates are the types of people in each group  every state has prioritized people most at risk  so the group of people vaccinated is heavily skewed toward those whose age and medical history make them prone to serious cases of covid     and death from it  so when the expected breakthrough cases do occur  it s not surprising some deaths would result  let s look at age  for example  older adults are at the greatestÂ risk of developing severe illness  requiring hospitalization and dying  with  Â  out of    covid    deaths reported occurring among adults aged    years and up  according to the cdc  and     of people vaccinated to date are in that age bracket  even though people    and older are just     of the total population  so those vaccinated areÂ a pool of people predisposed to more severe cases  fact check  fda did not associate pfizer s first vaccine dose with covid    infections among the over       breakthrough infections reported  nearly     are associated with people over the age of     we don t know the ages of those who have died after breakthrough infections because the cdc hasn t released that data  we rate theÂ claim that the death rate from covid    among fully vaccinated individuals is significantly higher than the unvaccinated false  based on our research  experts say because the total number of vaccine breakthrough infections isÂ unknown and voluntary state reporting to the cdc skews toward more serious covid    cases Â it is not possible to directly infer an accurate death rate  and regardless  any comparison between the vaccinated and nonvaccinated is heavily skewed by the fact that the vaccinated group at present has much higher proportion of older adults who are most at risk,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
social media posts claim that people vaccinated against covid    pose health risk to those who have not been immunized by  shedding  spike proteins  but experts say this is impossible  and that there is also no proof for the claim that the shots affect fertility  also read  flu cases are not being passed of as covid    cases  stay away from them   says an april          video post on instagram by woman who presents herself as nurse  the video has also been shared on facebook  rumble and bitchute  similar claims have been circulating on social media  and florida private school barred teachers who have been vaccinated against covid    from coming into contact with students  citing misinformation about the shots as justification  businesses in canada also barred entrance to people who were inoculated  more than     million covid    vaccine doses have been administered in the united states  most were pfizer s and moderna s mrna vaccines  though shot from johnson   johnson that employs different technology is also being used  below  afp fact check examines some of these inaccurate claims  also read  us doctor makes false claims about covid    vaccines  there are bunch of videos going around about how being around people who have had the  we ll call it  bax   are now experiencing severe symptoms and this is from shedding off of the spike proteins   the woman says in the video  but there is no evidence to suggest that they do  according to jamie scott  professor emerita at the simon fraser university faculty of health sciences   in fact  it s an impossibility  since all of the vaccines cause cells to produce only the spike protein  and no other components of the virus  so there s no way the virus can be produced by the vaccine   she told afp in an email  the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  explains on its website that the moderna and pfizer biontech shots  are mrna vaccines that do not contain the live virus that causes covid    and  therefore  cannot give someone covid      the mrna shots are the first to be authorized and distributed globally that use the cutting edge messenger ribonucleic acid technology  which differs from that of other vaccines  instead of confronting the immune system with part of virus in weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies  it introduces  blueprint  of the spike protein  part of the virus that the body can then recognize and fight if it encounters it later  this is how mrna vaccines work   dasantila golemi kotra  microbiologist at york university  explained in an email that  no spike protein gets shed when we get vaccinated   calling this claim  skewed science   she said that  even if the spike protein was shedding  although impossible  this protein cannot infect someone else     she added   proteins are sticky molecules and highly unstable  structurally and remaining as single piece   if it is digested it will be destroyed by the low ph in our stomach and the enzymes there  and if it is stuck in our skin or enters our mouth or eyes or nose it is very likely to be digested by the enzymes secreted by our cells on these environments   this was confirmed by barry pakes  assistant professor at the dalla lana school of public health at the university of toronto  he explained in an email that  there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of shedding of spike protein in vaccinated individuals  nor is it even theoretically possible   also read  no  us supreme court has not ruled against mandatory vaccination the woman in the video also argues that the mrna vaccines are causing  reproductive problems  and  sterilization   there is at this point no indication that covid    vaccines negatively impact women s reproductive health  according to multiple experts and public health bodies  the cdc says that  there is currently no evidence that any vaccines  including covid    vaccines  cause fertility problems   in joint statement  the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists  the american society for reproductive medicine and the society for maternal fetal medicine also said that  there is no evidence that the vaccine can lead to loss of fertility   while fertility was not specifically studied in clinical trials of the vaccine  the statement explains that  no loss of fertility has been reported among trial participants or among the millions who have received the vaccines since their authorization  and no signs of infertility appeared in animal studies  loss of fertility is scientifically unlikely   golemi kotra warned that most of the accounts shared on social media have not been peer reviewed by scientists and doctors  and there are  no such reports in any reputed scientific media   pakes added that  there are now over one billion doses administered      million in the us alone  if this were at all plausible we would see huge epidemic of bruising people  stillborn fetuses or amenorrheic women  we are seeing none of that   afp fact check previously examined inaccurate claims that the covid    vaccines cause infertility  other posts raise concerns that covid    vaccines could affect menstrual cycles  again linking it to supposed  shedding   research is underway to determine if there is causal relationship between the two  some experts suggest that the added stress of the pandemic could play part in cases in which women experienced menstrual changes  also read  covid     stanford has not published any study on masks being ineffective kathryn clancy  associate professor in the department of anthropology at the university of illinois urbana champaign  is leading research on the possible causal links between covid    vaccines and menstrual cycle changes  she said by email that multiple biological mechanisms might underlie menstrual changes with vaccination  including  changes in platelets  inflammatory processes  and vasodilation  all normal immune activation responses that you want to see with vaccination    so menstrual changes are not concerning  but rather short term side effects that are similar to sore arm  fatigue  fever   she added  some posts also raise concerns about the possible risks to pregnant women from the covid    vaccines and their purported shedding  afp fact check previously debunked misleading claim about the risk of miscarriage following vaccination  while scientific evidence is still scarce because pregnant women were excluded from the initial clinical trials  in february      pfizer biontech started study to assess the safety of their vaccine in pregnant women  the cdc states on its website that  based on how these vaccines work in the body  experts believe they are unlikely to pose specific risk for people who are pregnant   in fact  golemi kotra and pakes emphasized that pregnant women should get the shots because women are at higher risk for the worst outcome from covid    infection  the video repeats the recurring claim that covid    mrna vaccines can change person s dna  this is false  mrna shots are not gene therapy and cannot alter person s genetic makeup  according to experts  grant mcfadden  director of the biodesign center for immunotherapy  vaccines  and virotherapy of arizona state university  previously said that it is inaccurate to call mrna vaccines  gene therapy  because  they do not change the genetic dna of the host cells  and cannot alter the genes of the recipient s cells   the cdc also states on its website that  mrna vaccines do not interact with person s dna or cause genetic changes because the mrna does not enter the nucleus of the cell  which is where our dna is kept   golemi kotra explained that  no vaccine will alter the human make up of the body   the woman in the video further claims that  there s no way of knowing how long that it lasts if the human body will ever shut off this mechanism of producing these spike proteins  so the people that get the  shmaccine  may produce these spike proteins forever so it may never be safe to go near them again   this is false  mrna from vaccines cannot survive long term in the human body and thus cannot replicate indefinitely  according to experts  on its website  the cdc explains that  once the instructions  mrna  are inside the immune cells  the cells use them to make the protein piece  after the protein piece is made  the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them   jeffrey cirillo  regents  professor of immunology at the texas m college of medicine  previously said that  the body is natural off switch for any mrna  there are enzymes in the body that degrade mrna all the time   also read  covid    test control swabs only used for quality control and although our immune response will remember seeing the virus protein   there will not be any mrna or protein from the virus after few days   he said  other experts agreed  scott explained that  the current vaccines only promote the production of spike protein for short period  regardless of the vaccine    there s no biological mechanism for any of the vaccines to produce spike protein indefinitely   she added,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
the uk bought all the midazolam france had  this is false  the department of health and social care has confirmed that all of the midazolam stockpiled in the uk for the covid    crisis was sourced

vaccines approved for use in the uk  all of the animals used in vaccine trials died  there is no evidence for this  if animals had died after being vaccinated  human trials would have been stopped  which they werent  it is common practice in animal trials to euthanize the subjects so they can be examined  the mhra put out tender for artificial intelligence  ai  to handle reports of adverse covid

volume of reports of adverse reactions occurring after  though not necessarily caused by   covid    vaccination  covid    vaccines have the capacity to change your dna  it is untrue that covid    vaccines  which include mrna vaccines  have the capacity to affect your dna  mrna vaccines work by introducing molecule into the body which instructs cells to build disease specific antigen  the antigen is then recognised by the immune system which produces antibodies to fight the real thing  viral video made by influencer kate shemirani  posted on facebook  makes number of false claims Â  the six minute clip contains many unsubstantiated statementsincluding several that full fact has checked in the past  this article does not address every claim made in the video  including those made about specific individuals Â  heres look at seven key claims made throughout the video Â  towards the start of the video ms shemirani says we know we bought lots of midazolam  and questions where the drug has gone  she also said sales of the drug had risen exponentially in the uk  and asked why did we buy all of what france had Â  midazolam is sedative and sleep inducing drug  and is often used in intensive care or as palliative care medicine during end of life care to ease agitation or restlessness in the patient Â  it is true that the uk has stockpiled number of medicines  including midazolam  throughout the pandemic  but the drug was not imported from france and the uk certainly didnt buy all frances stock of midazolam Â  the claim appears to come from an article published in the pharmaceutical journal in may       in which the department of health and social care  dhsc  confirmed that some french label stock of midazolam was being sold in the uk market  it is unclear whether this stock had already reached france or had been produced and held in the uk  midazolam has been on the uk governments list of medicines that cannot be exported since march      Â  spokesperson for the dhsc told us  as part of our coronavirus response  we are doing everything we can to ensure patients throughout the uk continue to access the medicines they need  to manage increases in demand  we have been building uk stockpiles of key medicines  including midazolam  which are used to support covid    patients in intensive care and at the end of life  all of the midazolam purchased for the uk covid    medicines stockpile was sourced within the uk  has been licensed for use in the uk and was destined for the uk market  this claim  referring to the covid    vaccines  is untrue  analyses of the data from phase three trials for all three covid    vaccines  pfizer biontech  oxford astrazeneca and moderna  authorised for use in the uk have been published in peer reviewed studies in medical journals  as we recently reported Â  phase three trials are trials in thousands of people to determine vaccine safety and efficacy  and are the last stage before vaccine is put forward to healthcare agencies for authorisation and licensing Â  the fact that completion dates for phase three trials are set for      has been previously used to question vaccine safety  as we have written before  these dates are set in the future to allow for follow ups to take place Â  it is unclear what law is being referred to here  and no further details have been provided  full fact has been sent other versions of this claim  which have described the vaccine as medical device  as opposed to medicinal product such as vaccine  if we look at the relevant law  in this case section   of the human medicines regulations       medicinal products are defined as any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties of preventing or treating disease in human beings and any substance or combination of substances that may be used by or administered to human beings with view to restoring  correcting or modifying physiological function by exerting pharmacological  immunological or metabolic action Â  university of york law lecturer dr isra black  who specialises in healthcare law  told full fact that  while we cant be sure ms shemirani is referring to this definition  as the covid    vaccines contain substances that are administered to elicit an immune response  it appears that they meet the criteria for medicinal product Â  on the other hand  claims that covid    vaccines are medical deviceslanguage that is also used in the videodont appear to be consistent with the legal definition of medical device Â  the medical devices directive defines medical device as an instrument  apparatus  appliance  software  material or other article  intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of  diagnosis  prevention  monitoring  treatment or alleviation of disease  and which  does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological  immunological or metabolic means Â  dr black pointed out that  by definition  vaccines operate by immunological means  and so do not meet the definition of medical device Â  as we have previously reported  the three coronavirus vaccines currently approved for use in the uk through temporary authorisations have been through all the normal stages of vaccine testing  including animal and human studies  all three are effective at significantly reducing the risk of contracting symptomatic covid     the efficacy rate is calculated by comparing the number of vaccinated people who catch the disease to the number of unvaccinated people who catch the disease Â  we have looked at claims about animal deaths during covid    vaccine trials before  in those trials the vaccines did not kill every animal they were tested on  chris magee  head of policy and media at uk non profit understanding animal research  uar   told us that in the case of covid    vaccines  data already existed to indicate the vaccines were safe  which enabled researchers to run animal trials alongside the early stages of human trials  had the animals died during this process  he said  the human trials would have been immediately halted  the fact that they were not indicates the animals did not die unexpectedly  he also said animals used in drug trials are usually euthanized  so scientists can examine their internal organs for signs of pathology  this means if animals do die during medical trials  it isnt necessarily due to the drug being trialed Â  this is true  in november      it was reported that genpact  professional services firm  had been awarded     m contract to build an ai toolÂ  that could process the expected high volume of covid    vaccine adverse drug reactions  adrs  Â  reports of adverse reactions following covid    vaccinations are collected through the mhras yellow card reporting system Â  the mhra says  the nature of yellow card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects some events may have happened anyway  regardless of vaccination  this is particularly the case when millions of people are vaccinated  and especially when most vaccines are being given to the most elderly people and people who have underlying illness Â  the mhra told full fact in november that it was expecting around one yellow card report per       doses administered  at the time of writing  more than    million doses in total have been administered Â  the contract terms state that the mhras existing systems would be unable to handle the volume of adrs that will be generated during the uks largest ever vaccination programme Â  this is common claim that has been repeated throughout the pandemic  and one that we have previously addressed  it usually refers to mrna vaccines  such as the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines Â  the mrna vaccines work by introducing rna into the body which instructs cells to build proteins  also called antigens  found on the sars cov   virus Â  the antigen is then recognised by the immune system

have received at least one vaccine dose  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  if the vaccines were as deadly as bhakdi says  we would surely see widespread and mounting deaths in the vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers   federally managed database of self reported vaccine side effects  there are reports of vaccine related deaths in the vaers database  but because anyone  from doctors and nurses to patients and parents  can submit cases  the cdc says those reports are unverified and may be inaccurate  fact check  cdc data on adverse effects of vaccine cannot determine cause covid    vaccines are safe and effective  the cdc says on its website  to date  vaers has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate safety problem with covid    vaccines  bhakdi says in the video that the vaccines can kill people by causing autoimmune responses  he says thats because messenger rna  mrna  packages  genetic strands in the pfizer and moderna shots that tell your body how to defend itself against the coronavirus  dont leave the bloodstream and could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells  thats wrong on both fronts  fact checkers have repeatedlyÂ debunked the notion that covid    vaccines cause autoimmune disorders  there is no evidence to suggest they do  and bhakdis rationale for the claim  that mrna never leaves the bloodstream  isnt accurate  heres how it works  when someone receives vaccine from pfizer or moderna  mrna strands program cells to produce spike proteins similar to those on the surface of the coronavirus  the body recognizes those proteins as invaders and produces antibodies to block them  those antibodies prevent future coronavirus infections  once that process is completed  mrna doesnt linger in the bloodstream  fact check  fda did not associate pfizer s first vaccine dose with covid    infections the cell breaks down and gets rid of the mrna soon after it is finished using the instructions  the cdc says on its website  according to bhakdi  another way covid    vaccines are killing people is through the formation of deadly blood clots  thats an inaccurate spin on recent news about the johnson   johnson vaccine  in mid april  the cdc and the fda recommended pause in johnson   johnson shots after six cases of rare type of blood clot were reported in women ages    to    among the nearly   million people who received the johnson   johnson vaccine at the time  one woman in virginia died  fact check  cdc recommends masks in most cases even after covid    vaccine after review of the vaccines safety  public health officials recommended april    that johnson   johnson shots resume nationwide  review of all available data at this time shows that the j j janssen covid    vaccines known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks  the cdc says on its website  however  women younger than    years old especially should be aware of the rare but increased risk of this adverse event and that there are other covid    vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen  the claim that coronavirus vaccines are killing people and will decimate the worlds population is false  based on our research  public health officials say all three coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use in the u s  are safe and effective at preventing infection  there is no evidence the vaccines cause deadly autoimmune disorders  and reports of blood clots following the johnson   johnson vaccine are extremely rare,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

whether or not someone should worry is subjective decision  but any implication that young people are at no risk of serious covid    complications is fiction  so far  young  healthy people have been less likely to develop serious complications from covid     however  low risk is not the same as no risk  especially as variants spread  also  getting vaccinated decreases transmission of the disease  which can benefit young people s friends  families  and community members who may be at higher risk   on april           podcast host  mixed martial arts commentator  and non doctor joe rogan suggest to the millions of people who listen to the joe rogan experience  the most popular podcast on spotify in       that there is no need for young people to concern themselves with the covid    vaccine Â  rogan said  people say  do you think its safe to get vaccinated  ive said  yeah  i think for the most part its safe to get vaccinated  i do  i do  but if youre like    years old  and you say to me  should i get vaccinated  ill go no  are you healthy  are you healthy person   if youre healthy person  and youre exercising all the time  and youre young  and youre eating well  like  i dont think you need to worry about this  rogan  who has been vaccinated himself along with his family  said that he thinks it is safe to get vaccinated  but he goes on to suggest that young  healthy people have no real reason to get vaccinated  rogan is wrong Â  here are few reasons why young  healthy people should still get the covid    vaccine Â  rogans claim is based on the inaccurate assumption that covid    only affects the sick and elderly  while it is true that elderly people and those with underlying health conditions have greater risk of dying or suffering severe symptoms  young people are not immune to covid     according to data from the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   more than       people between the ages of    and    have died from covid    Â  abc   chicago reported on such young  healthy person who died from covid    in october       although the chances of death from covid    may be relatively low for young  healthy people  it is not an impossibility  as noted above  young  healthy people with no preexisting conditions have died from this disease  but death is not the only concern  long covid  term used to describe the lingering impacts of the disease  can also affect young and healthy people  for example Â mo bamba and jayson tatum  two    year old nba players who certainly seem to meet rogans definition of young and healthy  struggled for months to get back into nba shape after they were diagnosed with covid    in the summer of       as of this writing  both have returned to the league  but tatum now needs to take an inhaler to open up my lungs before games  its process  it takes long time  i take an inhaler before the game since ive tested positive  this has kind of helped with that and opened up my lungs  and  you know  i never took an inhaler before  so thats something different  these long covid    symptoms can manifest even in people who were not hospitalized after their initial diagnosis Â  while the elderly and infirm were at the greatest risk during the start of the covid    pandemic  that trend started to shift as the virus mutated in       more contagious strain of the virus called b       has been found in all    states and it has led to an increase in hospitalizations of young people Â  new jersey  for example  saw     jump in covid    hospitalizations in march among young adults ages    to     dr  jonathan reiner  cnn medical analyst and professor of medicine and surgery at george washington university  said  what were seeing in bunch of places now is sick  young people  hospitalized young people  whereas earlier on in the pandemic  it was primarily older people  what were seeing in bunch of places now is sick  young people  hospitalized young people  whereas earlier on in the pandemic  it was primarily older people  the reason for this might be as simple as the older population in this country has either been exposed to this virus  killed by the virus  or now vaccinated against the virus  the unvaccinated  those are the people who are getting infected  were seeing large number of young people  and theyre the ones were seeing in hospitals now  one of the most confusing aspects of the covid    pandemic has been the idea of asymptomatic transmission  this means that person may be infected with covid    even though they dont show any outward symptoms  although this asymptomatic person will avoid hospitalization  although they could develop long covid as mentioned above   they can still spread the disease to other people Â  in other words  young  healthy person may not suffer serious symptoms from covid     but they can carry the virus and pass it to someone who might  dr  anthony fauci  the chief medical advisor to united states president joe biden  emphasized this point when he addressed rogans comments  fauci said   rogan is  incorrect  and the reason why is that youre talking about yourself in vacuum then  youre worried about yourself getting infected and the likelihood that youre not going to get any symptoms  but you can get infected and will get infected if you put yourself at risk  and even if you dont have any symptoms you are propagating the outbreak because it is likely that you  even if you have no symptoms  that you may inadvertently and innocently then infect someone else who might infect someone who really could have problem with severe outcome  on april           rogan addressed this controversy on his podcast and attempted to clarify few of his comments  rogan said that he shouldnt be considered respected source of information  and that he doesnt often think about what he is going to say before he says it during his podcast  which  rogan admits  is usually recorded while hes drunk or high   the podcast host also emphasized that he was not an anti vax person and that there was lot of legitimate science behind these vaccines  rogan said that he was trying to suggest that young  healthy people had lower risk of serious complications from covid     which is generally true but  again  young people are not immune from this disease  but that he agreed with the argument that young people should get vaccinated in order to prevent the disease from spreading to more vulnerable communities  even though he believes that this would be separate conversation  heres partial transcript of rogans comments  the full video can be seen at the bottom of this article  theres some legitimate science behind  the vaccines   the thing about this whole thing  people being upset with me  i didnt say  im not an anti vax person  in fact  i said i believe that theyre safe and i encourage many people to take them  my parents were vaccinated  i just dont think that if youre young healthy person that you need it  there argument was you need it for other people   guest  so you dont transmit the virus   that makes more sense     heres the thing  these are not like planned statements  lets be real clear  when i say something stupid  im not thinking about what im going to say before i say it  im just saying it  i dont have an off air and on air voice  i have me  this is it  if you say you disagree with me  i probably disagree with me too  i disagree with me all the time  if someone said that young  healthy    year old people who eat well and exercise are not at high risk for coronavirus but you should think about other people  id say well thats different argument  but yes  that makes sense  but i would say arent those people  the vulnerable  vaccinated and shouldnt we vaccinate the vulnerable     im not doctor  im f cking moron  im cage fighting commentator whos dirty stand up comedian and i just told you im drunk most of the time and i do testosterone and i smoke lot of weed  im not respected source of information even for me i at least try to be honest about what im saying,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
an american physician and anti vaccination advocate claims in video viewed more than         times that widely used covid    vaccines have not been properly tested and pose long term health risks  but experts say her claims are inaccurate  the technology used in the inoculations was under development well before the pandemic  the shots were trialed on tens of thousands of people  and the us centers for disease control and prevention says that long term side effects are unlikely  also read  no  us supreme court has not ruled against mandatory vaccination     everyone who has any interest in the jab needs to watch this   says text accompanying video posted on instagram on april           the clip features dr sherri tenpenny  who is licensed as an osteopath in ohio  talking about purported risks of covid    inoculation  the clip is an excerpt from an interview she gave to daystar s  ministry now  program  which was viewed more than        times on video hosting site bitchute  similar claims by tenpenny regularly appear on social media  her website bills her as  doctor  speaker  educator  consultant   with offers of  unlimited premium podcast access  for     month and also includes prominent link for donations  study in      found tenpenny was among dozen people responsible for    percent of anti vaccine content on facebook and twitter  afp has previously fact checked her content     even as the us reached the milestone of administering     million covid    shots  disinformation about them has flourished  below  afp fact check breaks down some of the claims made by tenpenny in the instagram video  tenpenny adds that there are  zero long term studies on what s going to happen down the road with this anti spike antibody  what can happen with auto immune diseases      she is referring to the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines which are the first using cutting edge messenger ribonucleic acid  mrna  technology to be authorized and distributed globally  also read  covid     stanford has not published any study on masks being ineffective an mrna vaccine differs from regular shot in that  instead of confronting the immune system with part of virus in weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies  it introduces  blueprint  of the spike protein    part of the virus that the body can then recognize and fight when confronted by it later   tenpenny has made similar claims elsewhere online linking the shots to auto immune diseases and lung damage  but experts have told afp that evidence does not support claims that auto immune illnesses or lung damage are triggered by mrna vaccines  roselyn lemus martin  who has doctorate in molecular cell biology from oxford university and specializes in vaccines and treatment of covid     said that there is  no scientific proof  showing the mrna shots provoke auto immune diseases and  on the contrary  the technology  could help as therapy  to treat them  thalia garcÃ­a tÃ©llez  researcher in infectious diseases and infectology at cochin hospital in paris     said that auto immune diseases can be  the consequence of one or several dna mutations  the process by which these mutations appear has nothing to do with messenger rna   concerning the damage allegedly inflicted on the lungs by antibodies  palma rocchi  an mrna specialist and research director at the national institute of health and medical research  inserm  in paris  said  that is not supported by data in the scientific literature   and kate mullane  professor with university of chicago medicine  where she is director of infectious disease clinical trials  said   the antibodies do not cause tissue damage   scientists have widely rejected the unsubstantiated claim that mrna vaccines can modify human dna  and afp fact check has

messenger rna cannot  get into  our dna   this is inaccurate  studies have shown the mrna vaccines are safe and effective     in december  the us food and drug administration  fda  issued an emergency

million cases of covid     the disease caused by the coronavirus  and more than         deaths in the united states  the authorizations were not an  approval  from the  fda  but data supported the emergency allowance  because the vaccine s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks   peter marks  director of the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research  said at the time  more than        people participated in study of    the pfizer biontech vaccine and were followed for median of two months after receiving the second dose  the fda said    the most commonly reported side effects  which typically lasted several days  were pain at the injection site  tiredness  headache  muscle pain  chills  joint pain  and fever   it said  similar study was conducted for the moderna vaccine with similar results     both companies submitted plans  to complete longer term safety follow up for participants enrolled in ongoing clinical trials   the fda said

have received covid    vaccines  and no long term side effects have been detected  cdc continues to closely monitor covid    vaccines   university of chicago s mullane said that these vaccines  are not new  there is long term data on mrna vaccines for influenza showing no long term toxicity   thompson  of the university of toronto  said   while the pfizer and moderna vaccines are indeed the first successful mrna vaccines  the technology has been used for decades   research on using mrna technology for vaccines started in the early     s and included promising tests on animals  also read  posts falsely claim       people have died due to covid    vaccine in us more than     million people have received at least one dose of vaccine in the us  and the vast majority have been mrna shots

there s gender gap in the national vaccination rollout  reportsÂ looking at state vaccine statistics show more women are gettingÂ vaccinated than men Â  the finding is worrisome given men are more

debunked by usa today  those claims  however  centered around woman herself gettingÂ vaccinated Â  while person infected with covid    does shed virus with coughing  sneezing or talking  vaccinated person doesn t carry or transmit any disease causing particles  experts sayÂ changes to woman s reproductive health because of this supposed exposure areÂ pure fiction Â Â  here s why Â  vaccines  biological preparations used to train the immune system to fight disease  affect only the person receiving them Â   there is no sort of mechanism that would even exist that would suggest in any way  vaccine  could be transferred  or lead to sequence of events that would alter pregnancy or menstrual cycle   said carolyn coyne  microbiologist and professor of molecular genetics and biology at duke university Â  coyne said covid    vaccines are delivered to the body in very small particles covered in fatlike substances called lipids  vaccines remain inside cell once inside  never to be re released again Â  pfizer s and moderna s vaccines use type of dna called mrna that  when taken up by cells  is degraded once the coronavirus s spike protein is manufactured Â  the spike protein does remain in the body for some time  but not forever  and it similarly cannot be transmittedÂ to another person  coyne said  fact check  military funded sensor can help detect covid     but it s not microchip dr  daniel kuritzkes Â chief of the infectious diseases division at brigham and women s hospital  agreed with coyne  telling reutersÂ Â that the mrna vaccines  contain only instructions for making spike protein and are incapable of generating virus particles  so nothing can be shed  Â  while the j j vaccine relies on different technology called viral vectorÂ  weakened common cold virus modified to containÂ genetic instructions for the spike protein s construction Â no other person  except for the vaccine recipient  can be affected Â  but there is stillÂ a small chance of passing the virus even if one is vaccinated  this is because of new reports of people getting covid    despite being fully vaccinated  called vaccine breakthrough cases  or infections Â  the number of these cases is still small Â aboutÂ       out of more than    million vaccinated  according to the latest data from the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  this wasn t unexpected because  while the vaccines have been shown to be greatly effective  they don t prevent  illness     percent of the time   the agency said Â  the post attempts to link changes in menstruation and pregnancy to contact with vaccinated people  but the truth is  changes in both situations occur relatively often  so any connected timing is coincidental  experts say Â  according to the mayo clinic      to     of known pregnancies end in miscarriage  although the actual frequency may be higher since  many miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that woman doesn t realize she s pregnant  Â  menstruation  or the period during woman s monthly cycle whenÂ the inner lining of the uterus is shed  is influenced by multitude of factors such as weight loss or gain  eating disorders  stress  hormonal birth control  poor sleep and conditions like endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome Â  between    and     of women can have irregular periods between their first period and the age when periods end  or menopause  according to the american academy of family physicians Â  there have been reports of covid    infection affecting menstruation  but experts are still unclear exactlyÂ how Â anecdotes of women experiencing menstrual changes after getting the covid   Â vaccineÂ have also surfaced  but there haveÂ been no data to suggestÂ a definitive link between the two Â  fact check  nursing newborns are not having reactions to covid    vaccine we rate the claim that viral shedding from covid    vaccinated person can cause women to miscarry or experience menstrual changes false  based on our research  the pfizer  moderna and johnson   johnson vaccines only provide the body instructions on how to makeÂ theÂ coronavirus spike protein  neither the mrna of pfizer s or moderna s vaccines  nor the viral vector of the j j vaccine  can replicate on their own or cause illness  similarly  the spike protein generated cannot be shed and infect others  miscarriage is unfortunately common

was the novel coronavirus launched as diversionary tactic to distract the masses from misdeeds of global elites  and is covid    less dangerous than the seasonal flu  no  that s not true  experts in public health and virology have published several peer reviewed papers dismissing as conspiracy theories the claim that the covid pandemic was launched on purpose  the nation s leading infectious disease expert says the infectiousness of covid makes it much more dangerous than flu and statistics bear him out  standard mortality statistics for      show more than         deaths due to covid  with the overall death rate rising for the first time since the federal government began keeping mortality statistics in       debunked conspiracy theories claiming  elites  caused the pandemic have

  it opened  this is what the post looked like on facebook at the time of writing         source  facebook screenshot taken on mon apr                  utc  fuellmich  who repeatedly has said he will prosecute world leaders at trial like the nazi war crimes trial at nuremberg  tacitly compares hitler s killing of   million jews to the quarantines and other public health measures imposed to slow the covid    pandemic  in the opening of the video  he alludes to his prosecution plan  there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that what has been happening here for year now is these are the worst crimes against humanity ever  ever  committed  in the video  fuellmich provides no documentation  witnesses or other credible independent corroboration of his claims of global conspiracy  this fact check will address the major claims  not in chronological order  fuellmich is an attorney licensed in california with an office address in goettingen  germany  where his website says he practices consumer protection law  it is unclear  and not readily confirmed on his website or other online sources  if the  dr   title he uses refers to his juris doctor degree or if he has medical training  it s an extraordinary claim whose seriousness demands extraordinary evidence  but fuellmich supplies only an elaborate conspiracy  starting at about six minutes     seconds  fuellmich describes    with no documentation or witnesses    financial misdeeds by the wealthiest  who he says have stolen taxpayer dollars and were about to be caught when he says they turned loose the virus that causes covid      they started to print money in order to keep us quiet in late       i believe  when things were  again  coming to head and things were  again  about to implode  they came up with corona as diversionary tactic   while some scientists were disappointed by the chinese government s refusal to grant full access to the wuhan infectious diseases lab near the first reported outbreak  world health organization convened study team reported on march           that the virus likely spread from animals in food markets to humans  environmental sampling in huanan market from right at the point of its closing showed out of     environmental samples in huanan market     samples were positive  this revealed widespread contamination of surfaces with sars cov    compatible with introduction of the virus through infected people  infected animals or contaminated products  in march of       team of five microbiologists from the u s   u k  and australia  writing in nature s medicine journal showed their genetic analysis concluded human caused release of the virus from laboratory was improbable  they wrote that genetic features of the virus more strongly suggest the viruses found in various animals mutated  evolving into the novel coronavirus that thrives in human bodies  at    minutes     seconds  fuellmich discounts the effectiveness of public health measures and the seriousness of covid     just like every flu season  people get sick  people get seriously sick and some people die  what happened in italy  in bergamo  for example  or in new york  is probably more result of malpractice than it is result of the flu or the coronavirus if you want to call it that  there s something out there  because if it weren t  people wouldn t get sick and people wouldn t die  but as it turns out the infection fatality rate of whatever is going on is no higher than that of the common flu  study of hospitalized patients in france  published in lancet respiratory medicine march          found covid is more likely to kill than is the flu and that while the rate of hospitalization of children for covid is lower than for flu  there is higher death rate for in hospital pediatric covid patients than for those who have the flu  dr  anthony fauci  director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  has said what makes covid    more dangerous than the flu is that it is more likely to spread  in addition to being lethal for many patients  at this congressional hearing in march of       early in the pandemic  he estimated covid    was    times more lethal than seasonal flu  since then  development of covid    vaccines has changed the outlook for covid patients and social distancing and masking programs    rarely used against seasonal flu    have been shown to slow the spread       at nine minutes     seconds  fuellmich says the world health organization  who  is not governmental organization    the who  the world economic forum  these are

in february       anti vaccine activist and conspiracy theorist robert f  kennedy jr  shared facebook post purporting to describe new research published by veteran immunologist j  bart classen in journal named microbiology   infectious diseases  the study in question asserted to have found evidence that pfizers covid    vaccines could cause neurological degenerative diseases  in april       the right wing national file promoted this same study  describing the research as credible  apparently basing this conclusion on nothing more than the fact that it appears in what looks to be legitimate scientific journal  classen is not veteran immunologist  he is an anti vaccine activist who operates the website vaccines net  until the covid    pandemic hit  the primary purpose of this website  operated by his company classen immunotherapies  was to push his own discredited pet theory that some vaccines cause diabetes  now  the website explains  he is concerned that the current outbreak of covid    is actually bioweapon attack and may be linked to the us anthrax attack of       which originated from the us army base fort detrick  the journal microbiology   infectious diseases is  at best  dubious  it is published by the company scivision  which was identified on beals list as potential predatory publisher  such publishers profit from publication fees with little regard for enacting meaningful peer review  predatory journal could explain why classen has been able to publish four scivision papers since the pandemic began  including one that copy and pastes full sections from previous paper  one that argues the spate of e vaping lung injuries reported in late      was actually caused in part by covid     and one that argues the mmr vaccine may have been used to selectively inoculate people in      and      in anticipation of purported covid    bioweapon  the latter theory was inspired  he said in that allegedly peer reviewed journal  by the arrest of jeffery epstein  still  robert f  kennedy jr and national file want us to take classen and his body of work seriously  in the spirit of keeping an open mind  we dug into the claims he makes and the evidence he uses to support those assertions  this is fairly quick exercise because classen asks us  in effect  to just trust him without actually showing any of his work  national file promoted classens study with the headline  pfizer vaccine confirmed to cause neurodegenerative diseases  the neurodegenerative diseases alleged to have been caused by the pfizer shot belong to broad group of usually fatal diseases known as prion diseases  or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  though poorly understood  these diseases are caused by type of protein known as prion that  according to information provided by the johns hopkins medical school  can trigger normal proteins in the brain to fold abnormally  prion diseases occur when normal prion protein  found on the surface of many cells  becomes abnormal and clump in the brain  causing brain damage  the hopkins medicine page explains  this abnormal accumulation of protein in the brain can cause memory impairment  personality changes  and difficulties with movement  experts still dont know lot about prion diseases  but unfortunately  these disorders are generally fatal  classen  in his paper  argued that the rna in mrna vaccines like pfizers may induce two specific proteins  tdp    and fus  to fold into their pathologic prion configurations  such finding would be important  classen argued  because folded versions of these prions have been linked to neurologic disease  does classen provide any empirical evidence to support this rigorous sounding conclusion that mrna vaccines induce the folding of these proteins  he does not  in lieu of evidence to support this claim  classen asserts that the vaccine rna was analyzed for the presence of sequences that can activate tdp    and fus  though he provides no other methodological details  this type of analysis typically involves comparing rna code for similarities identified in sequences of rna known to produce prions and is generally coupled with heavy statistical analyses to determine that outcomes likelihood  classen asserts that  through his completely undescribed methodology  he found series of rna sequences that may cause tdp    or fus to fold into pathogenic form  we reached out to robert garry  virologist at tulane university and an expert in the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis who is also involved in vaccine development  to see if perhaps snopes had missed the part of the paper where classens title claim is defended  dr  classen offers no statistical analysis to show that these occur more frequently in the sequence derived from the sars cov   spike gene  garry told us by email  the body is filled with rna  dr  classen has not demonstrated by any stretch of the imagination that the sequences in the pfizer vaccine are special or unexpected beyond anything that occurs purely by chance  classen also argued that the binding of spike protein  produced by the vaccine  to ace   the chemical in blood the spike binds most strongly to  has the potential to release the zinc molecule  an ion that causes tdp    to assume its pathologic prion transformation  this is  according to garry  an evidence free assertion that is  on its face  absurd  zinc is an essential mineral  it does not cause prion disease  he told us  there is no evidence that binding of spike to ace   releases zinc intracellularly  garry told us  in fact  the zinc in ace   is extracellular  so even if in the unlikely event that spike binding released zinc it would be extracellular not intracellular  the binding of small amounts of spike to ace  would not affect the intracellular zinc or extracellular zinc concentration in biologically meaningful way  it would be like saying that dropping few grains of salt into the ocean increased salinity in dangerous way  in other words  these are big claims that challenge some very basic scientific concepts  and they rely entirely on us taking classen at his word methodologically  for some of the purported sequences classen claims to identify  he even admits he needs more sophisticated computers to verify them as accurate  this is not  to put it mildly  confirmation of anything  even if national file asserts as much in its headline  this paper was published by an anti vaccine activist who believes that the u s  government may have created covid    and preemptively vaccinated some people through the unrelated mmr vaccine  it was published in journal widely viewed to be predatory  which means it likely went through little to no peer review  the paper does not serve as an evaluation of the pfizer covid    vaccine to induce prion based disease in vaccine recipients  garry told us  it is nonscientific speculation and fear mongering by known anti vaccine campaigner  the study itself is series of problematic assertions presented without evidence  as such the claim that scientists have confirmed that the pfizer vaccine causes neurological damage from prion diseases is false  company navigate sections account,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

as of april       the u s  food and drug administration  fda  advised that individuals who either received live attenuated covid    vaccine or did not know what kind of vaccine they received should wait two weeks before donating blood  however  the fda advised that individuals who received nonreplicating  inactivated or mrna covid    vaccine  including the pfizer biontech  moderna  and johnson   johnson vaccines  could donate blood without delay  provided they were otherwise eligible to do so  since only relatively tiny number of individuals had received live attenuated vaccine as part of clinical trial  the overwhelming majority of covid    vaccine recipients were  therefore  eligible to donate blood without delay   in the spring of       as growing number of people in the united states received their first or second dose of covid    vaccine  rumors emerged on social media that those who had been vaccinated were barred from donating blood or required to wait before doing so  for example  facebook users enthusiastically shared meme which advised as follows  requesting youth between    to    to please donate blood before vaccination begins from  st may  as after vaccination one cant donate blood till minimum    days variant of the meme set the purported deferral period as minimum    days Â  in response to rumors such as those  american red cross told snopes it received multiple inquiries from social media users about the rules for blood donation after covid    vaccination  in reality  the vast majority of covid    vaccine recipients in the united states need not wait to donate blood  as of this articles publication  in the u s  context  rumors  memes  and other online claims that vaccinated individuals must wait before donating blood were largely inaccurate  and we are issuing rating of mostly false  the u s  food and drug administration  fda   the federal agency that oversees and regulates the collection of blood and blood products  such as plasma  has explicitly stated that  individuals who received nonreplicating  inactivated  or mrna based covid    vaccine can donate blood without waiting period  the three covid    vaccines that the fda has authorized for emergency use in the u s   those produced by pfizer biontech  moderna  and johnson   johnson  all meet that description  johnson   johnsons vaccine uses nonreplicating viral vector  while the other two are mrna vaccines   therefore  anyone who has received one of those vaccines can donate blood without delay  assuming they are otherwise eligible to do so  the fda has further advised that anyone who has received different kind of covid    vaccine  known as live attenuated vaccine  should wait for two weeks until donating blood  since the fda has only approved the three vaccines mentioned above  this advisory appears to only apply to individuals who have received live attenuated covid    vaccine candidate as part of clinical trial  based on check of the u s  national library of medicines clinicaltrials gov database  we estimate fewer than     people have received that type of covid    vaccine  hence our assessment that the overwhelming majority of vaccinated individuals can  according to the fda  donate blood without delay  the fda has also advised that if an individual isnt sure what kind of covid    vaccine they received  they should wait two weeks before donating blood  simply as precaution  in keeping with that advice  american red cross  leading coordinator of blood donation in the u s   told snopes they were accepting blood donations from vaccinated individuals  provided they know the name of the manufacturer and are not still suffering some of the common side effects from vaccination  such as muscle aches  soreness  or fever  the red cross is also asking vaccinated people who dont know the name of the vaccine they received to wait two weeks before donating blood  upon closer inspection  the minimum    days and minimum    days meme highlighted above appeared to have been posted and shared online mainly by users from india  or in india  however  the text of the warning did not include any details that would reflect that geographic specificity  and users from various other countries  including the u s   may have mistakenly interpreted it as applying to them  snopes is not aware of the provenance of that particular meme  but we do know that  at least in the context of india  it appears to contain significant grain of truth  according to several news reports in india  the government run national blood transfusion council announced in march      that vaccinated individuals should not be allowed to donate blood until    days after they receive their second dose  since the recommended period between doses is also    days  this meant that the total delay period between receiving your first covid    vaccine dose and donating blood was    days  hence the two variants of the meme setting out    minimum days and    minimum days  however  that advice applied only within india  and it was not clear whether it still represented the position of indian authorities as of april,[1. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

as an advocacy group and alternative to the mainstream media  in the video  the groups founder  monica smit  claims the federal government is trying to hide adverse reactions from covid    vaccines  the video features information published on the website of ausvaxsafety  an organisation which monitors adverse events following immunisation  ms smit cites data from the website as evidence that the adverse reaction rate to covid    vaccination is not good sign for something that is completely safe and that     to     per cent of people have ended up in hospital  at the time of writing  two posts from the group featuring the video had been shared more than      times and viewed more than        times  while the video claims the australian government is trying to hide adverse reactions to covid    vaccines  the data used to support other claims included in the segment is based on published information from government funded organisation  in addition to the work of that entity  ausvaxsafety  government agency the therapeutic goods administration  tga  also releases weekly safety report on covid    vaccines as part of its remit of monitoring vaccine safety  the tga has also reported publicly in detail on cases where blood clotting and death were potentially linked to the astrazeneca vaccine  in the video post  ms smit refers to the ausvaxsafety covid    vaccine safety surveillance page  archived versions of the page show the data on reported adverse reactions has been published since the beginning of australias vaccine rollout  while the tgas reports begin at similar date  the page visible in the video shows data based on voluntary survey responses from people who have received the pfizer comirnaty vaccine as of april     according to the data       per cent of        people reported no adverse event from their first dose and      per cent reported an adverse event  ausvaxsafety gathers data via text message or email survey questions sent to people who have received vaccinations from certain providers  responses are voluntary  and the organisation repeatedly warns on its website against assuming the self reported events  which were not clinically verified  are all causally related to the vaccine  commenting on the data in the video  ms smit says       mark      per cent of people reported some sort of adverse event from the first dose  thats    per cent of people that had some sort of reaction  now it could have been minor  could have just felt like fatigue and so forth  but still thats not good sign for something that is completely safe as  federal health minister  greg hunt says  however  the types of reported reaction are clearly outlined  graph on the page shows frequently occurring events  including injection site pain the most common at      per cent  fatigue at      per cent and headache at      per cent  these are acknowledged on the page as symptoms that are generally mild and short lived and known to occur after vaccination  the profile of reported events from ausvaxsafety surveillance for both comirnaty and covid    vaccine astrazeneca is similar to that reported in clinical trials and from post marketing surveillance overseas   an ausvaxsafety spokeswoman told aap factcheck in an emailed statement  these expected adverse events are related to the immune response to vaccination and are expected to resolve within     days after vaccination  data from large scale clinical trial of the pfizer vaccine showed    per cent of recipients reported an adverse event  although some of these were deemed unrelated to the vaccine  only four serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported among more than        recipients  ausvaxsafetys spokeswoman also told aap factcheck that the published date only represents information from vaccine recipients who responded to the survey  approximately    per cent of vaccinated people who were sent survey did not complete the survey  she said  the data provides some indication of the rate of events commonly occurring amongst people who have received vaccines  although rates of adverse events may not be precise estimate of the true rate of adverse events  the tga website states  ausvaxsafety findings support the tgas assessment that the covid    vaccines used in australia meet safety standards  the video contains other statements that misrepresent information on the ausvaxsafety web page  at the      mark  ms smit says that the number of reports on the ausvaxsafety site went up by        overnight  saying  this number was        yesterday  its now up to        in one day  however text at the top of the ausvaxsafety page  under the covid    vaccine safety surveillance headline  clearly states that data is updated weekly  referring to statistic that      per cent of respondents reported missing work  study or other duties for short period after second vaccine dose  ms smit says       mark  that almost    per cent of people have had to miss day of work or study or some of their duties  however  the description beneath that statistic says it actually represents those who missed work  study or duties for short period  adding that the majority of that cohort missed less than one day  the video also includes claim       mark  that     per cent of astrazeneca first dose recipients and     per cent of pfizer second dose recipients ended up in hospital  however the data referred to states that     per cent of astrazeneca dose recipients and     per cent of pfizer recipients reported seeing doctor or going to emergency department in the days after vaccination  there is no indication as to whether any of the cases were admitted to hospital  associate professor paul griffin  an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist from the university of queensland  reiterated to aap factcheck in phone interview that while the ausvaxsafety system is useful to alert experts of any safety signals relating to vaccines  reported symptoms may be unrelated to the vaccine itself  he added that there is also risk of biases in self reporting systems  we do know that the more significant adverse events are more likely to be reported  particularly if they require medical intervention  for example  he said  aap factcheck has previously debunked claims regarding the misinterpretation of covid    vaccine adverse events in overseas surveillance systems  the video makes the false claim that the government is hiding information about covid    vaccine adverse reactions  in fact  the government funded ausvaxsafety and the tga  which is part of the federal department of health  regularly publish information on reported adverse events  while the video goes on to refer to real data published by ausvaxsafety  it makes number of incorrect or misleading interpretations of that information to suggest that it shows the vaccines are unsafe  false  content that has no basis in fact,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0.

you can get side effects of covid    vaccines simply by being in close proximity to someone who has had the vaccine  this is false  there is nothing in the covid    vaccines used in the uk that could cause vaccine shedding  some social media posts claim that unvaccinated people can experience covid    vaccine side effects  particularly issues with fertility  simply by being in close proximity to people who have had vaccine  this is not true  the three types of vaccine developed to stop sars cov    the virus which causes covid     do not contain materials that could lead to vaccine shedding  there is also no evidence that vaccines affect fertility Â  fears about vaccine shedding  especially in live attenuated vaccines  are based on viral shedding  the process by which cells of the body release viral particles and could therefore  theoretically  increase the risk of infecting others Â  live attenuated vaccines  often referred to simply as live vaccines  contain whole bacteria or viruses which have been weakened  attenuated  so they can stimulate an immune response but do not actually cause the disease in healthy people Â  there are three covid    vaccines currently approved for use in the ukpfizer biontech  astrazeneca oxford and moderna  none of them use live version of sars cov    the virus that causes covid    Â  professor andrew pollard  director of the oxford vaccine group  told full fact  i cant think of any biologically plausible mechanism for shedding of components of any of the licensed covid    vaccines after immunisation  former chair of the bmas public health medicine committee dr peter english  retired consultant specialising in communicable disease control  told us  the mrna vaccines  pfizer biontech  moderna  do not contain anything that replicates and could possibly infect anyone else Â  its absolutely ridiculous to suggest that there could be any shedding of anything from someone who s had one of those vaccines Â  dr english  former editor of vaccines in practice magazine  added  the other type of vaccine used in covid    is the vector vaccine  oxford astrazeneca   and there i can see that people might be concerned about people being infectious with the vector virus Â  but those viruses are replication deficient which means the  scientists  can grow them in culture by adding an additive  which the viruses need to replicate but doesnt exist in the human body  once they stick them in the human body they cant actually produce more copies of themselves  all they can do is produce copies of the spike protein  so they cant be passed on to anyone else either Â  the suggestion that anybody could be infected with the vaccine virus by being in contact with someone whos been vaccinated is pure misinformation at best  and disinformation at worst Â  there is third type of vaccine  known as antigen vaccines  none of which have yet been approved for use in the uk  similarly to the mrna vaccine  dr english said  there is nothing in these vaccines that could possibly be shed or passed on Â  one of the social media posts claims vaccine shedding from the covid    vaccine can cause bleeding  bruising  spontaneous periods and miscarriages while another warns of anecdotal evidence that women are reporting miscarriage  suddenly bleeding while pregnant  heavy periods and irregular cycles after being in contact with people who have been vaccinated  we can find no confirmed reports of this  at the time of writing  pregnant women in the uk are being offered the moderna and pfizer vaccinations after evidence from the us showed there were no specific safety concerns  public health england says that it still advises that pregnant women should discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their clinician  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because there is no evidence that any of the materials in the covid    vaccine could cause vaccine shedding,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
covid    vaccines are experimental  covid    vaccines have been through number of clinical trials which have shown their benefits far outweigh any currently known side effects  vaccines interfere with your dna  vaccines do not interact with your dna in any way  covid    vaccines weaken your immune system  there is no evidence that covid    vaccines weaken the immune system  video posted on facebook by former mep godfrey bloom  which has more than        views  makes several claims about covid    vaccines and certificates  aka covid    passports  Â  weve written more about the possible introduction of covid certificates here  the rollout of vaccine certificates has not been legislated or mandated by the government and plans are still under discussion  as has been widely reported  there is disagreement about whether the government should introduce covid certificates  many mps say they plan to oppose any vaccine certificate scheme Â  in the video  mr bloom said  this is not traditional vaccine  this is experimental and as i say big pharma have been quite upfront about the fact that it is experimental Â  we have repeatedly debunked number of claims that covid    vaccines are experimental Â  the three covid vaccines currently approved for emergency use in the uk have demonstrably shown high levels of protection against infection  and the expected benefits of the vaccines are said to far outweigh any currently known side effects Â  some of the vaccines used in the uk are mrna vaccines  the technology behind mrna vaccines has been developed over number of years  both mrna covid    vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would  weve said this before but it bears repeating  its normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved  this monitoring happens with all vaccines  including those that have been in use for years  to detect any adverse effects  just because studies into these vaccines are continuing  it doesnt mean the vaccines are experimental  mr bloom also said   there are virologists and immunologists who are saying that it isnt now that is the problem  it is  in the  years to come when you have interfered with your own immune system and your dna  as we have said number of times  vaccines do not interfere with your dna  some of the covid    vaccines are rna vaccines  these contain messenger rna  mrna  which codes for protein specific to the pathogens surface  the body uses this mrna to build its own copies of these proteins which the immune system responds to by producing antibodies providing protection if the person catches the real disease later  fundamentally  however  it does not change the dna of human cells  in the video  mr bloom said   it could be that if your immune system is degraded in few years time  the fact that you have had this jab may be complete reversal  it may be then that you can t fly  you can t go into concerts  you cant go into the pub because it s gone full circle and now what was maybe good for you today is not good for you then  government advice states that immunosuppressed adults may not respond as well to the covid    vaccine as others and there is ongoing research to establish the safety of the vaccine among people with existing immunosuppressed health conditions  however  there is no evidence to suggest that covid    vaccines weaken or degrade healthy immune systems Â Â  we spoke to the science media centre who asked experts what they thought of this claim  dr peter english  retired consultant in communicable disease control  and former editor of vaccines in practice magazine said  as vaccinologist  i cannot see how this relates to anything that science tells us  i can see no reason to claim that current covid    vaccines   all of which seem to induce vigorous cellular immunity  as well as an antibody response   are likely to impair future immunity in any way  professor charles bangham frs fmedsci  chair of immunology  imperial college london  added  while some infectious agents such as hiv can indeed weaken the immune system  there is no evidence that the making of an immune response itself  whether to vaccine  pathogen or toxin   weakens the immune system Â Â  the immune system has evolved to be remarkably powerful and flexible  so that it can combat pathogens and toxins that we have never encountered before  and it does not lose this potential as result of making response Â Â  indeed this is in large measure how our ancestors survived  and why we are here now Â  vaccines themselves are extremely unlikely to weaken the immune system  and the benefit they have given to both humans and animals has been  and continues to be  enormous  this article

of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because covid    vaccines are not experimental  covid    vaccines do not interfere with your dna and covid    vaccines do not weaken your

a viral facebook post lists   facts about the three covid    vaccines currently in use in the united states  these facts are listed as follows  none are fda approved  all are considered experimental  none have completed initial research trials  all were allowed to skip animal trials  none will complete research trial for     years  all are free of liability even if one kills you  some of these claims are false or missing context Â  first  lets start with the claim that none are fda approved  while its true that no single vaccine has been granted fda approval  all three vaccines have been given an emergency use authorization by the fda  both moderna and pfizer are on track to apply for full fda approval based on the results of their phase iii clinical trials  however  its worth mentioning that on april    the cdc and fda released joint statement recommending pause in the distribution of the johnson   johnson covid    vaccine to look into six reported cases of rare and severe type of blood clot  according to the fda  emergency use authorization  eua  is mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures  including vaccines  during public health emergencies  the fda notes on its website that an eua permits the use of unapproved medical products  or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose  treat  or prevent serious or life threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met  including that there are no adequate  approved  and available alternatives  the center for disease control also states  covid    vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials  the vaccines met fdas rigorous scientific standards for safety  effectiveness  and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization  eua   next is the claim that all of the vaccines are experimental  while its true that mrna vaccines are new  the technology is not  the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines are mrna vaccines  as the cdc explains  researchers have been studying and working with mrna vaccines for decades  interest has grown in these vaccines because they can be developed in laboratory using readily available materials  this means the process can be standardized and scaled up  making vaccine development faster than traditional methods of making vaccines Â  furthermore  according to the cdc  mrna vaccines have been studied before for flu  zika  rabies  and cytomegalovirus  cmv   as soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes covid    was available  scientists began designing the mrna instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mrna vaccine Â  the johnson   johnson vaccine is viral vector vaccine  which  per the cdc  scientists have been creating since the     s  according to gavi  the vaccine alliance  viral vector vaccines work by using modified virus  the vector  to deliver genetic code for antigen  in the case of covid    spike proteins found on the surface of the virus  into human cells  by infecting cells and instructing them to make large amounts of antigen  which then trigger an immune response  the vaccine mimics what happens during natural infection with certain pathogens  especially viruses  this same viral vector technology has also been used in ebola vaccines Â  the claim that none have completed initial research trials is false  results from pfizers phase iii trial were published in the new england journal of medicine in december       total of        participants underwent randomization  of whom        received injections         with bnt   b  and        with placebo  there were   cases of covid    with onset at least   days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive bnt   b  and     cases among those assigned to placebo  bnt   b  was     effective in preventing covid    Â  modernas phase iii clinical trial results  which were published in the new england journal of medicine on december           included        participants who received the moderna vaccine or placebo  there were    covid   cases in the moderna covid   vaccine group and     cases in the placebo group  with vaccine efficacy of            confidence interval of       to         lastly  the johnson   johnson also completed its phase iii clinical trial  with        participants  resulting in data suggesting that  the vaccine was    percent effective in preventing severe disease across all regions studied  and showed protection against covid    related hospitalization and death  beginning    days after vaccination  the claim that all three covid    vaccines skipped animal testing is also false  both pfizer and moderna tested vaccines on mice and macaques  as reported by the associated press  both drug companies were given approval to test the vaccine on animals while also testing humans during phase i of clinical trials  per the associated press  johnson   johnson tested its vaccine on syrian golden hamsters  the claim thatÂ  none will complete research trial for     years is also false  continued clinical trial and study of the pfizer vaccine is listed in the u s  national library of medicine as beginning on april           and an estimated study completion date of april          modernas study completion day listed in the u s  national library of medicine is october           and the estimated study completion date for johnson   johnson is january          lastly  the claim all are free of liability even if one kills you is  for the most part  true  because the secretary of health and human services declared the coronavirus aÂ  public health emergency and invoked the public readiness and emergency preparedness act  prep act  in february       drugmakers are largely protected from covid    vaccine related lawsuits  per the congressional research service  however  as written in the prep act  pharmaceutical companies are not protected in cases of willful misconduct Â  the prep act provides immunity from liability  except for willful misconduct  for claims  of loss caused  arising out of

associated press  johnson   johnson tested its vaccine on syrian golden hamsters  the claim thatÂ  none will complete research trial for     years is also false  continued clinical trial and study of the pfizer vaccine is listed in the u s  national library of medicine as beginning on april           and an estimated study completion date of april          modernas study completion day listed in

by saranac hale spencer posted on april          viral video features doctor making dubious claims about covid    vaccines and treatments at forum hosted by idahos lieutenant governor  dr  ryan cole claims mrna vaccines cause cancer and autoimmune diseases  but the lead author of the paper on which cole based that claim told us there is no evidence mrna vaccines cause those ailments  no vaccine or medical product is      safe  but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval  followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects  in addition  the food and drug administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high quality and free of contaminants  one key vaccine safety surveillance program is the vaccine adverse event reporting system  or vaers  which is an early warning system run by the centers for disease control and prevention and fda  as its website explains  vaers is not designed to detect if vaccine caused an adverse event  but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring closer look  anyone can submit report to vaers for any health problem that occurs after an immunization  there is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem  the information is still valuable because its way of being quickly alerted to potential safety issue with vaccine  which can then be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people  which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts  revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks  the cdc and fda vaccine safety monitoring systems  which were expanded for the covid    vaccines and also include new smartphone based reporting tool called v safe  have subsequently identified only few  very rare adverse events Â  for more  see how safe are the vaccines  link to this more than         people haveÂ diedÂ from covid    in the u s   but two effective mrna vaccines are now available Â someÂ treatmentsÂ for certain patients  such as those hospitalized or receiving oxygen  have also been approved or authorized by federal agencies  and they continue to be studied  since the pandemic began  however  politicized social media posts have featured doctors  some looking authoritative in white coats  spreading dubious claims about both vaccines and treatments for covid     the most recent example in this misinformation niche is dr  ryan cole  who owns medical lab in idaho  cole is featured in video that has amassed more than million views  he makes variety of claims  some of which weve addressed before  the video was recorded while he spoke at forum on march   hosted by idahos lieutenant governor  janice mcgeachin  republican  and it was posted by libertarian organization called the idaho freedom foundation  mcgeachin was featured in an october post by that group  posing with bible and gun in video that advocated against public health measures related to the pandemic and asked viewers to sign statement saying that any order issued in the future will be ignored  cole said in an interview with factcheck org that hes not affiliated with any political party  group or organization  according to the idaho secretary of states office  cole is registered as republican  in the march   video  cole makes claims suggesting that federal agencies have acted nefariously  as well as claims that undermine vaccines and promise miracle treatments  well address his four main claims  two of the covid    vaccines available in the u s  use messenger rna  or mrna  to train recipients immune systems to make antibodies that fight the virus that causes covid      see scichecks articles on those vaccines  guide to modernas covid    vaccineÂ and guide to pfizer biontechs covid    vaccine   these are the first vaccines using mrna technology authorized in the u s   but scientists have been developing and testing mrna vaccines for years  including in people during clinical trials  still  misinformation exploiting fears of this new technology has been common online  to those bogus claims  cole has now added  mrna trials in mammals have led to odd cancers  mrna trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases  not right away  six  nine     months later  we asked cole to provide support for those claims  and he referred us to      paper published in the journal nature reviews drug discoveryÂ that reviewed trials and studies of various  earlier mrna vaccines  but that paper doesnt support his statement  norbert pardi  research assistant professor of medicine at the university of pennsylvania  was the lead author of the paper  he told us in an email  no publications demonstrate that mrna vaccines cause cancer or autoimmune diseases  pardis    page paper does make one passing reference to autoimmune diseases  which is what cole highlighted to us  the paper says  possible concern could be that some mrna based vaccine platforms induce potent type i interferon responses  which have been associated not only with inflammation but also potentially with autoimmunity  thus  identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mrna vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken  but  pardi explained  he and the other researchers included that passage because they wanted to note some potential concerns  however  he emphasized that no scientific evidence has confirmed that these concerns are real  its also worth noting that the paper predated the covid    pandemic by two years  soÂ it doesnt include any information specifically about the covid    vaccines  simply put  there is no scientific evidence that shows that mrna vaccines cause autoimmune diseases  pardi said  multiple clinical trials have been performed with mrna vaccines in the past    years and none of them found that mrna vaccination caused autoimmune diseases  further  we are not aware of any studies showing an autoimmune disease appearing many months after vaccination as dr  cole inaccurately suggests  likewise  dr  roger shapiro  associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at harvards t h  chan school of public health  told us in an email that he was unaware of any study that would support coles claim that the vaccines are carcinogenic  there is nothing in the science of mrna vaccines that would suggest carcinogenicity  and they have been tested in humans for other diseases before covid     shapiro said  mrna rapidly breaks down in the body  and probably does not last long enough to act as carcinogen  regarding autoimmunity  he said  this is always concern with any medical product  but there is no evidence to date suggesting it  and it does not seem any more likely than with other vaccines  mrna is made all the time in our bodies  and delivering it by vaccine should not be different  dr  dean winslow  an infectious disease physician at stanford health care  concurred with the other experts with whom we spoke  in phone interview  he characterized coles claims about cancer as fearmongering and said  theres just no scientific basis for that  were talking about these very small fragments of messenger rna that dont hang around for long at all  he said  noting that the mrna vaccines have been in use for almost six months and have been very safe  very well tolerated vaccines  winslow recognized that some people are concerned that the mrna from the vaccine might persist in their bodies and somehow change their genetics or cause long term effects  so he emphasized that the vaccines have small fragments of rna  which survive only briefly and carry information about the virus that causes covid     similarly  pardi told us  covid    mrna vaccines do not alter our dna and they get rapidly degraded so they do not promote cancer formation  cole also suggested in the video that the federal government had suppressed treatment for covid    in order to vend vaccine   well address his claims about the supposed treatment in the next section   if theres treatment for disease  the federal government cannot approve vaccine by law  by rule  cole falsely claimed  suggesting that federal agencies were withholding access to treatment for covid    so that they could instead profit from vaccines  so  the nih  who  you know  is involved in approving medications  they co hold the patent on the vaccine with moderna  cole said  referring to the national institutes of health  an agency that does not approve medications  if the fox is not guarding the henhouse there  i dont know who is  that also is insanity to have the government in bed with private company vending product that they want to give to everybody  there are several problems with this statement  first  there is no law barring vaccines if treatments are available for given disease  said jorge contreras  professor in the college of law at the university of utah who specializes in intellectual property and genetics and the law  he asked  why would there be such law  clearly there isnt  contreras pointed out  since the food and drug administration authorizes flu vaccine every year while tamiflu  an antiviral drug used to treat the flu  has been available since the fda approved it in       its certainly true that many diseases that we vaccinate for  there is no known cure for  he said  noting that this is often the case with viral diseases  which are hard to treat  but thats not legal requirement  thats scientific reality  he said  as for coles claim about the nih  that agency conducts and funds research  it doesnt approve drugs  medical devices or vaccines  thats function of the fda  the nih did collaborate with moderna on the development of its covid    vaccine  asÂ weve explained  government researchers had previously been working with scientists at moderna on an investigational vaccine to protect against mers  another disease caused by coronavirus  the team was able to apply that knowledge to design covid    vaccine  since the nih does research  it also files and receives patents  many of which it licenses to pharmaceutical companies  so  contreras said  nihs patents stemming from research on mrna vaccines are to be expected  and use of those patents by pharmaceutical companies is also to be expected  similarly  scientists from government funded labs sometimes share credit on patents with scientists from privately funded labs  thats normal  too  contreras said  generally  he explained  there are two reasons that the nih licenses its patents to companies  first  the nih is taxpayer funded institution  and it can recoup some of its investment in research by lending out the use of its discoveries  second  the clinical trials required to bring drug or vaccine to market are risky and expensive  so  theoretically  making its discoveries available to companies can encourage the private sector to take the risk and create products  so  cole mischaracterizes the relationship between the nih and the vaccine manufacturers when he says that its conflict of interest to have the federal government in bed with vaccine company  its actually normal to have pharmaceutical companies use government owned patents  and hes wrong when he says of federal agencies  they dont want therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine  theres nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for covid     neither the world health organization nor the national institutes of health has recommended the use of ivermectin  common anti parasitic medication  in the treatment of covid     merck  the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin  has similarly noted that there is  n o scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid    from pre clinical studies  no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid    disease  and  concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies  but cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is treatment for covid     he suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines  as we explained above  were in farm country  horse country  you know  you give it to your dogs  your cats  your horses  cole said in the video  addressing an audience in idaho  ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals  but crossover use in humans can be dangerous  while cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug  not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine  the fda has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for covid    has grown  ivermectin does have antiviral properties  but the fda hasnt approved it to treat any viral infections  it is being studied with regard to covid     though  according to both the who and nih  treating covid    with ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials  but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use  said shapiro  the harvard professor  my understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems  the trials so far have showed no benefit or worsening disease  some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance  and some did show possible mortality benefit  but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases  he said  winslow  from stanford  cautioned that there have been many claims for miracle cures over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating covid     ivermectin truly is wonder drug for parasitic diseases  he said  but my suspicion is that it will be lot like hydroxychloroquine  hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former president donald trump as treatment for covid     although studies found that it wasnt an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients  as weve explained before  the problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine  which are promoted as having broad spectrum antiviral properties  is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells  winslow said  even potent versions  like remdesivir  which winslow referred to as the gold standard of specific antiviral therapy in covid    treatments  only accelerates the time to recovery  but doesnt significantly reduce death rates or mortality from covid     remdesivir is the only drug approved by the fda to treat covid     the approval is forÂ patients requiring hospitalization  so  coles claim that there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in washington who have suppressed this life saving medication  is unfounded  ivermectin hasnt been proved to be effective  another of the major points that cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin d could have in fighting covid     if you do not supplement with vitamin d in the wintertime  you are immune suppressed  most insurance companies in idaho and northern states do not pay for vitamin d test  unfortunately  said cole  whose lab offers several vitamin d tests  after eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus  cole said  what should public health message number one  two  and three be  vitamin d  vitamin d  vitamin d  its true that vitamin d  which is mostly associated with bone health  plays part in the immune system  but that doesnt mean its panacea for covid     as weve explained before  while lot of basic research points to vitamin d having role in the immune system  it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit covid    patients  as weve written  studies assessing whether vitamin d can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally beenÂ inconsistent  recent article from npr looked at the research on vitamin d with respect to covid    over the last year and found  essentially  the same thing  it also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin d levels areÂ associated with higherÂ risk of contracting covid    or withÂ becoming seriously ill  while these studies raised hopes among some researchers  others are skeptical  noting that most of these are observational studies  not the gold standard randomized  controlled trials  the story said  much of the available evidence only shows association  not causation  and even those results are mixed  walter willett  professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the harvard t h  chan school of public health  told npr  in september  dr  anthony fauci  the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  said in an instagram live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin d  i would not mind recommending  and i do it myself  taking vitamin d supplements  but  as we wrote before  excessive doses should not be used,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

zombies have long captivated human imagination but they don t exist in real life  or do they  according to one social media post  these fictitious creaturesÂ soon will  due in large part to the covid    vaccines Â Â   now the new so called experimental vaccine   the really new and amazing thing about it is that it s not even vaccine  mrna is not vaccine   claims video shared in march    facebook post Â Â  the man speaking  abdul alim muhammad who goes by mukifuad on instagram  and fromÂ whose account the video originates  Â claims the covid    mrna vaccine is instead  an operating system such as you would put in your computer  designed to hijack the body s cellular machinery to produce  the same  covid     viral proteins that made you sick in the first place  Â Â  muhammad tells his viewersÂ not to take his own word for it  description of the vaccine as an operating system is prominently visible on moderna s own website  fact check  no evidence of miscarriage surge since vaccine rollout he also goes on to claim there are four vaccine doses  each for different coronavirus protein  the spike proteinÂ  which muhammadÂ claims is the reason why  people test positive for hiv   and three others referred to as m  n and p proteins Â  after the fourth dose  the human body is turned into  viral making factory  that attacks itself  ultimately giving rise to generation of zombies  conclusion muhammad claims is supported by the existence of u s  centers for disease control and prevention website dedicated to  zombie preparedness  Â Â Â  the over    minute video  the first four minutes of which are from muhammad s original instagram video and the rest news clips from various outlets like cbs and fox news  has amassed nearly        interactions on facebook according to social analytics platform crowdtangle Â Â Â   we need to rise up  in numbers to push against this agenda to take over   wrote one facebook user in the video s comment section Â   it is not vaccine  your immune system will be compromised  you don t need it  another lie   claimed another  fact check  nursing newborns are not having reactions to covid    vaccine usa today has reached out to the original poster and muhammad for further comment Â Â  dna  or deoxyribonucleic acid  is the moleculeÂ containingÂ the genetic instructions needed for all livings things to develop  live and reproduce  in multi cellular organisms like humans  dna resides in the nucleus  packed into bundles called chromosomes Â Â  because it can t itself physically exit the nucleus  when molecules like proteins are needed  sections of dna are transcribed into form that can leave  messenger rna  or mrna  once outside the nucleus and in contact with cell s protein making machinery  the encoded protein is made  mrna has no further reason to stick around at that point so it s destroyed  disappearing much like snapchat message Â  using mrna to make vaccines may be relatively new technology  but the idea of harnessing this genetic modality has existed for the last    years  first pioneered by katalin kariko at the university of pennsylvania  before covid    arrived on the scene  mrna vaccines hadÂ been developed for ebola  zika and influenza  although none have yet been licensed Â according to the cdc Â Â  Â Â Â  both pfizer biontech and moderna s mrna vaccines  the only two mrna vaccines authorized and administered in the u s   contain instructions for the coronavirus  surface  or spike protein  used by the virus like key to enter cells  the spike protein by itself is harmless and cannot cause disease  but it does induce the immune system to produce antibodies against it and any virus bearing the protein  immunity being the fundamental criterionÂ for any vaccine  as mentioned earlier  the vaccine s mrna has short lifespan and is destroyed quickly Â Â  more  how mrna vaccines work for the mrna vaccines Â two doses are neededÂ to achieve robust and effective immune response  contrary to muhammad s claim  there are no additional doses after the two except for booster shots targeting the new variantsÂ and to extend existing immunity against any future disease  these boosters do not contain any mrna for the other viral proteins mentioned in the video Â Â Â  that the spike protein is the reason why  people test positive for hiv  is also unfounded  it s unclear where the claim originated  but itÂ may stemÂ from social media posts linking the coronavirus with hiv  suggesting covid    is man made Â   the spike glycoprotein of sars cov   is just like the spike of every other  coronavirus    said vincent racaniello Â a professor of microbiology and immunology at columbia university  in an email to the associated press last may   it is not from hiv    this post is pure nonsense  fake science  and not worth responding to  Â Â Â  muhammad s insinuation that the vaccine is not real because it s an  operating system  is based on very literal interpretation ofÂ moderna s analogy comparing its mrna technology to software on computer Â  fact check  cdc data on adverse effects of vaccine cannot determine cause one thing is true  the cdc does have website for zombie preparedness  first conceived in may      to raise awareness about an upcoming hurricane season Â and teach emergency preparedness  using fictitious zombie apocalypse  the website recently arose from internet obscurity with the claim that the   th century french astrologer nostradamus foresawÂ a zombie apocalypse in      and that the cdc s website was evidence as such  claim that usa today has debunked  we rate the claim that mrna vaccines are not real vaccines but operating systems that will induce the body to produce covid    false  based on our research  messenger rna  or mrna  is form of dna that provides the cell instructions for making certain proteins  it is one time use molecule that is destroyed once the protein is made  this mechanism is harnessed by mrna vaccines  which instruct the immune system to make antibodies against covid    s spike protein  the two mrna vaccines available only require two doses  not four as claimed by the video shared on facebook  and only contain mrna for the spike protein  not other viralÂ proteins  vaccination will not turn vaccine recipients into zombies  theÂ cdcÂ website on  zombie preparedness  was created in      as vehicle for

mandatory vaccine certificates are being introduced  there has been no suggestion certificates will be mandatory across all settings  although plans are under discussion  covid    vaccines are experimental  all uk covid    vaccines have been shown to be effective and safe through clinical trials  covid    vaccines dont prevent infection or transmission of the disease  evidence shows vaccines have significant effect on the infection rate of covid and reduce transmission  the covid    death rate for most of us is        the terms here are poorly defined and seem to be based on disputed research  the       death rate figure  for younger people  is disputed  facebook post that has been shared more than       times claims  were about to be forced to have digital id  proving weve had an experimental vaccine  which doesnt prevent infection or transmission of virus that most of us have       chance of dying from  so we can live normal life  can people really not see through this  the claims in this post are largely false or misleading Â  the claim regarding digital id appears to refer to covid    vaccine certificates  also known as vaccine passports   these are documents which would prove persons covid    vaccination or infection status  these are not currently mandated by the uk government Â  the government has published roadmap reviews paper which discusses how certificates could be used in everyday life  the paper includes details of government led events research programme  which will run number of trials in april and may to test how covid status certificates could be used to reintroduce large public events like football matches and concerts  and reduce border restrictions for travellers  it also states how businesses will legally be able to ask for proof of covid    status from customers  provided doing so doesnt break equality laws Â  if certificates are formally introduced  the government says it is unlikely anyone would require certificate to access essential shops  essential public services and public transport and people for whom vaccination isnt advised and repeat testing is difficult are likely to be exempt from such scheme Â  however  talks are ongoing  vaccines minister nadhim zahawi recently said certification is only one option while some mps say they will vote against it if it is brought to parliament Â Â  therefore  with no legislated policy  clear indications there will be exemptions and more debate  or even vote  on the matter  there isnt enough evidence to suggest that covid    passports will be mandatory or forced Â  it is also not true the vaccines are experimental  the three covid    vaccines currently approved for use in the uk have already been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials Â  some of the vaccines used in the uk are mrna vaccines  while these are the first mrna vaccines to be rolled out to the general public  the technology behind mrna vaccines has been developed over number of years  both mrna covid    vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would  its normal that authorities continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines even after they have been approved  this monitoring happens with all vaccines  including those that have been in use for years  to detect any adverse effects  just because studies into these vaccines are continuing  doesnt mean the vaccines are experimental  as we have said before  vaccines significantly reduce the risk of developing covid    Â  clinical trials have shown recipients of the pfizer vaccine were     less likely to contract covid    compared to placebo treatment while the moderna vaccine has been shown to be     effective  recent trials of the astrazeneca vaccine showed it was     effective against symptomatic covid          effective against severe or critical disease and hospitalisation  and     effective against symptomatic covid    in participants aged    years and older Â  and while the risk of transmission does not disappear following vaccination  initial evidence suggests vaccines help stop the spread of the sars cov   virus which causes covid    Â  the european centre for disease prevention and control  ecdc  notes that there is only one study on the impact of vaccination on the risk of transmission so far  scottish study which has not yet been peer reviewed  which suggested vaccination of household member reduced the risk of infection to susceptible households by at least     Â  however  the ecdc also stated the total number of infections is expected to decrease significantly as vaccination coverage increases  provided that there is match between the vaccine strains and the circulating virus strains which would lead to decreased transmission overall  it is very difficult to calculate an accurate death rate for covid     because we do not know exactly how many people have been infected and therefore what proportion of people have died Â  the post claims there is       death rate for covid    for most of us but doesnt clarify what most of us means  it appears to be based on systematic review of covid    studies  from stanford university  which suggests that only   in       people         under the age of    infected with covid    would die from the disease   Â  the review has been disputed by epidemiologists who say the death rate varies greatly among age groups  one peer review noted the populations sampled in the review varied greatly which was inappropriate to analyse together and that the infection fatality rate estimated was lower than those reported in multiple other studies Â  the review also did not thoroughly examine the effect of pre existing medical conditions such as diabetes  hypertension and lung disease  which are associated with severity of covid    symptoms and mortality Â  its also unclear whether the reference to most of us in the facebook post does mean under   s  according to the world health organization  estimates suggest that the overall death rate for covid    is somewhere between      and    of all people who catch it  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false

false                 because vaccine passports have not yet been introduced and there is no reason to believe they will be mandatory  the uks covid vaccines are not experimental  there is evidence to prove the efficacy of the covid    vaccines and how they reduce transmission and the death rate figure has been widely questioned,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
by claim  viral whatsapp message claims that taking painkillers such as diclofenac after receiving the covid    vaccine is harmful and can lead to death  the claim that taking painkillers after receiving the covid    vaccine is harmful and can lead to death is mostly true  experts views and studies show it can be risky  especially when taken without doctors prescription Â Â  the controversy around the covid    vaccine has been prevalent since its emergence  several arguments around its efficacy  effectiveness  affordability  regardless of its have led to the proposition of multiple theories regarding the vaccine  recently  piece of viral information making rounds on whatsapp claims that taking pain killers like diclofenac and others after receiving the covid    vaccine can be hazardous and may even lead to death Â  the claim ties the narrative to the demise of certain dr  hari harini who was alleged to have died when herÂ  doctor husband injected her with dose of diclofenac after she had earlier received the covid    vaccine  the information was shared multiple times on whatsapp  accompanied by the picture of the acclaimed late doctor and her husband together Â  covid    vaccine related claims have attracted massive traction in the past  its sensitivity and risk to peoples health and general wellbeing cannot be underestimated  it is because of this reality that dubawa opts to confirm the veracity of the information Â Â  as regards the doctors death  dubuwa uncovered that multiple fact checks have already been conducted which confirmed the doctors death but ruled out taking pain killers as the causative factor Â  according to fact check conducted by indias thenewsminute  findings outlined that doctors have ruled out the covid    vaccine as the reason behind the death of young woman doctor in madurai on    march  the medical administrator of meenakshi mission hospital  madurai  dr  kannan told the news minute that the woman doctor had been administered the covid    vaccine on   february  month before she was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state Â  so also on thequint where the same findings were registered  nonetheless  as regards pain killers being harmful and deadly after receiving the covid    vaccine  some guidelines issued by the centre for disease control  cdc Â  on theÂ  interim clinical considerations for use of covid    vaccines currently authorized in the united states advised that it is not recommended you take these medicines  pain killers  before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects  talk to your doctor about taking over the counter medications  such as ibuprofen  acetaminophen  aspirin  or antihistamines  for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated  you can take these medications to relieve post vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally  study published in the journal of virology conducted on whether to take pain relievers after receiving the covid    vaccine also found that nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  nsaids  which include painkillers like ibuprofen reduced the production of antibodies and other aspects of the immune response to sars cov    since antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight viruses like sars cov    the covid    vaccines stimulate the body to produce antibodies that specifically target the coronavirus without causing disease  thus the authors of this study explained that this raises the possibility that pain killers might also affect the immune response to coronavirus vaccination  also  dr  sherrill brown  medical director of infection prevention at altamed health services  federally qualified healthcare center serving los angeles and orange counties in california Â  agreed with the findings of the study  adding that i would recommend waiting until someone experiences side effects of fever or pain that require fever reducing or pain reducing medications  she said  and not to take them as prophylaxis to prevent vaccine related symptoms  dr  brown further explained that some people are not able to take either acetaminophen or ibuprofen due to other underlying health conditions  she said  in those cases  it would be best to consult with their trusted healthcare provider or physician before taking these medications  if you cant take pain relievers  or you would like to avoid taking them after your coronavirus vaccine injection  there are other ways to relieve vaccination side effects  to reduce pain and discomfort at the site of injection  apply cool  wet washcloth over the area to reduce the swelling  gently exercising the arm also increases blood flow to the area which can provide additional relief Â  unduibisi okeke of the limi hospital  abuja  pharmacist  also shares similar views with dr  brown  he explained to dubawa that the covid    vaccine is alien to the body system  so  body pain is likely because of the effort the body system is making to adapt to the vaccine  he added thatÂ  if body pain perseveres  however  one can take just paracetamol not major pain relievers as diclofenac  etc  nonetheless  he concluded that the vaccine just came in recently and studies are still being carried out to understand its nature but its good to be on the safer side and avoid all sorts of pain relievers before or after the covid    vaccine  findings show that taking pain relievers after the covid    vaccine can indeed be hazardous  especially without doctors

in the spring of       covid    and vaccine conspiracy theorists enthusiastically shared meme that claimed one or all of the covid    vaccines available at that time were called luciferase  and effectively warned readers not to accept them due to satanic connotations or associations Â  the meme  shared widely on facebook in march and april       read as follows  are you going to get the shot called luciferase with patent number        and digital program called inferno   luciferase is real scientific term that describes group of naturally occurring enzymes that  under the correct conditions  cause the emission of light  however  the meme was grossly misleading and inaccurate in several ways  no covid    vaccine is called luciferase  and no covid    vaccine contains luciferase  rather  luciferase has been used in some covid    related research  furthermore  the concerns over the name of the enzyme were irrational and appeared to be based on lack of understanding of the origins of the word  on the whole  were issuing rating of false as to the claim that covid    vaccines are called luciferase  luciferase refers to group of enzymes  substances that trigger chemical reactions   which act upon type of chemical compound called luciferins  with the result being bioluminescence  that is  the emission of light by living organism  the most common example of the work of luciferase is found in fireflies  luciferase enzymes and luciferin compounds were discovered in the late   th century by french scientist raphaÃ«l dubois  their names are derived from the latin roots lux  meaning light  and fero  meaning to bring or carry  thus  light bearing  so  contrary to the misplaced fears of satanic association or connotation underlying the meme  the lucifer of the christian tradition merely has the same etymological roots as luciferase enzymes and luciferin compounds  no covid    vaccine is called luciferase and neither do any of them contain the enzymes in question  as shown in the full ingredient lists for the pfizer biontech  moderna  astrazeneca  and johnson   johnson janssen vaccines  in reality  the only link between luciferase and covid    vaccines is that some research has used the enzymes to study issues related to covid    and vaccine candidates  because of the light emitting properties of luciferase  they are useful in tracking biological processes Â  in       for example  researchers in the laboratory of pei yong shi at the university of texas medical branch  utmb  in galveston used luciferase in both diagnosing the presence of covid    antibodies in subjects  but also in testing the effectiveness of covid    vaccine candidates  texas medical center wrote at the time that  researchers harnessed luciferase to develop faster diagnostic testing through innovative assaysinvestigative procedures that measure the activity or amount of substance  the lab can now visually confirm the presence of antibodies that can block sars cov   infection earlier than through previous methods  shi said his team has been collaborating with leading pharmaceutical companies to help them evaluate their vaccine candidates  specifically by measuring the immune response in humans in clinical trials  his labs systembased on reporter viruses in which the luciferase enzyme is inserted into the virus genome to make it easy to followmeasures the concentration of neutralizing antibodies while also allowing for much higher throughput  according to xuping xie  ph d   assistant professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at utmb  this way of measuring the immune response is more accurate than traditional methods  the sensitivity and the dynamics of the assay  because of the luciferase  can really allow us to discern any small changes that the conventional way would not  said xie  its much more sensitive  much more accurate  when you test antiviral compounds  researchers at the university of south florida also used luciferase to track the effect and spread of the covid    virus within the body  tom mcdonald explained the research as follows  its good surrogate for whether or not the virus can get into particular cell type  and you can actually quantify it  you say it gets in more  it gets in less  that type of comparison is easily made with the firefly luciferase  dr  mcdonald explains by adding that virus to lung  heart  and vascular cells  they can see how well the virus gets into those cells and which ones are vulnerable  when you have this  they glow in the dark  said mcdonald  you dont have any background noise here so that your ability to precisely quantify how much of the virus is getting in by this technique is very precise  the second component of the meme  the claim that covid    vaccines have patent number,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
source  social media users  facebook  instagram  twitter     apr       Â      review   in april       multiple social media posts and articles claimed that covid    vaccines cause menstrual problems in vaccinated women  see examples here  here  here  and here   others even claimed that vaccinated women were causing unvaccinated people around them to develop health problems  and called for vaccinated people to be kept away from others  see screenshot of facebook post   several of these posts went viral on multiple social media platforms  discussions about the potential effect of covid    vaccination on menstruation appeared to have increased following tweet by kathryn clancy  professor of anthropology at the university of illinois who studies womens health and the menstrual cycle  published on    february       clancy expressed curiosity over whether women vaccinated against covid    recently experienced very heavy periods as she and others did  her tweet received over     replies and     retweets  colleague told me she has heard from others that their periods were heavy post vax  i m curious whether other menstruators have noticed changes too  i m week and half out from dose   of moderna  got my period maybe day or so early  and am gushing like i m in my   s again   dr  kate clancy    kateclancy  february           clancy began survey to study the frequency of menstrual changes that occurred following covid    vaccination  while some people used her survey to suggest that the vaccine was responsible for menstrual irregularities and reason not to take it  see an archive of now deleted tweet making this suggestion   clancys response made it clear that she encouraged women to get vaccinated  there is little to no information available regarding changes in womens menstrual cycles after covid    vaccination  in blog post  gynecologist jen gunter found that clinical trials for the authorized covid    vaccines didnt have any public data on this subject  she also noted that vaccine clinical trials generally dont study this subject  therefore  at the moment  there isnt sufficient evidence to draw causal association between menstrual changes and covid    vaccines  this facebook post alleged that there have been tens of thousands of reports and therefore there is likely causal relationship  the basis of the posts claim that there have been tens of thousands of reports is unclear  search of the u s  vaccine adverse events reporting system  vaers   which records adverse events occurring after vaccination  showed total of     reports of menstrual problems for covid    vaccines as of    april       not tens of thousands as claimed   figure    vaers data on events related to menstruation after covid    vaccination  extracted on    april       however  caveat is that vaers relies on voluntary reporting  hence the records are likely incomplete and dont reflect all events following vaccination  furthermore  although anecdotal reports of menstrual irregularities surfaced on social media platforms  it is important to remember that millions of women received covid    vaccines who may not have discussed their menstrual cycles  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   more than     million people in the u s  received at least one dose of covid    vaccine as of    april        figure    cdc data on covid    vaccinations in the u s  as of    april       the cdc data isnt broken down by gender  but many state specific dashboards do report breakdown of vaccinations based on gender     april kaiser health news article reported that of    states that did break down vaccinations based on gender  all    found that women made up more than     of vaccine recipients so far  if we put this information together and assume that the survey results are representative of all states  then more than    million women received covid    vaccines  in addition  many factors unrelated to vaccines  such as changes in diet and physical activity  as well as underlying illnesses like endometriosis and uterine cancer  can also result in menstrual irregularities  in light of these complexities  it is important to compare the prevalence of an event between unvaccinated and vaccination groups to determine whether vaccine caused particular event  and see if the prevalence is significantly higher in the vaccinated group  we also need to consider that abnormal uterine bleeding and heavy menstrual bleeding  menorrhagia  were estimated to affect    to     in women of reproductive age     meaning that such events arent rare  but in the absence of systematically collected data on menstrual irregularities in vaccinated women  we arent able to compare prevalences in unvaccinated and vaccinated women  at the moment  the dearth of information on this topic means that we cannot rule out menstrual changes induced by covid    vaccines  indeed  gunters blog post delved into several biological mechanisms that could explain genuine link  such as changes in chemical signals between various parts of the body that regulate the menstrual cycle  specifically the brain  uterus  and ovaries  these effects could be from the vaccine itself  the immune system response to the vaccine  or potentially related to fever or feeling unwell from the vaccine or stress related to vaccination  she wrote  there are lot of complex immune system interactions in the lining of the uterus that are also involved in menstruation  but gunter refuted claims about vaccines causing infertility  as seen in this lifesitenews article  stating that these arent supported by data  safety monitoring via the cdcs v safe smartphone based tool has also not shown signals for concern   figure    cdc data released on   march      comparing the background rates  representative of unvaccinated people  of various pregnancy related outcomes with rates in vaccinated women who had reported events in the v safe health checker tool  until scientific studies to determine if there is link between covid    vaccination and menstrual irregularities are available  gunter suggested that potential menstrual irregularities can be viewed as vaccine side effect like fever   i ts sign the immune system is being activated  and in the same way that fever doesnt make people permanently hot after vaccine  menstrual irregularities will not be permanent either  still others went even further  claimingmainly on the basis of anecdotal reports on social mediathat vaccinated people are causing health problems in unvaccinated people around them  as seen in these posts by james lyons weiler  christiane northrup  and larry palevsky  all three individuals previously published vaccine misinformation  see here  here  and here   instagram influencer chloe angeline  who goes by the handle of selfhealingmama and has more than        followers  also made the same claim in now deleted instagram video  archived here  there simply isnt biological mechanism that would explain the phenomenon of vaccine affecting other people by proxy  as gunter explained in another blog post  neither of the pfizer or moderna vaccines  which use mrna  messenger rna   nor the johnson and johnson vaccine  which uses viral vector  can possibly affect person who has not been vaccinated  and this includes their menstruation  fertility  and pregnancy  northrup claimed that vaccinated women were influencing the menstrual cycles of unvaccinated women  this claim appears to be based on the popular idea of period syncing  also known as menstrual synchrony   although there isnt evidence supporting the existence of period syncing  both northrup and palevsky claimed that shedding from vaccinated individuals was responsible for health problems in unvaccinated people  in this article  david gorski  professor of surgery at wayne state university and editor of science based medicine  explained why the claim is false  as gorski described  the shedding of vaccine virus can only happen with live virus vaccines  such as the oral polio vaccine and rotavirus vaccine  but theres critical difference between viruses used in vaccines and the viruses that cause disease  theres difference between shedding and causing disease  however  for one thing  the strains of virus used in live attenuated virus vaccines are just thatattenuated  theyve been weakened so that they dont cause actual disease  otherwise  using live virus vaccine would be the same as giving the disease to the person vaccinated  which would rather sabotage the whole purpose of vaccination in the first place  in palevskys case  he specifically implicated the rna vaccines in shedding  since rna vaccines dont contain the virus itself  and therefore cannot cause someone to shed the virus  palevsky instead claimed that vaccinated individuals were shedding the spike protein  and this was the cause of illness in unvaccinated people  he also suggested that spike protein produced by vaccinated people is the cause of illness in unvaccinated people  because covid    patients also have high amounts of spike protein in their bodies  the claim is unsupported by evidence  as gorski pointed out  while the rna in covid    vaccines provide cells with instructions for how to make the spike protein of sars cov    the rna degrades fairly quickly and therefore wouldnt cause cells to persistently churn out spike protein  nor would the amount of spike protein produced be high enough to be excreted by the person  palevskys claim also implies that spike protein alone is sufficient to cause illness  but this isnt supported by evidence either  gorski explained that covid    patients are ill due to the replication of the sars cov   virus in their bodies  the reason sars cov   is infectious is because droplets containing the virus suspended in the air get inhaled and manage to take up shop in the respiratory tree  replicating and making lot more virus  protein alone cant do that    its the virus  its replication in cells leading to massive cell death  and the immune response provoked by the virus in the context of infection that lead to the severe illness we see  overall  there isnt sufficient evidence to draw causal link between covid    vaccination and the menstrual irregularities that vaccinated women experienced  studies will be needed to shed light on whether the vaccines induce changes in womens physiology  however  claims that the covid    vaccines adversely affect fertility or pregnancy arent supported by safety data  the claim that vaccinated people somehow cause unvaccinated people to become ill  which is based on unverified anecdotal reports  is scientifically baseless  no biological mechanism exists that would explain

companies use government owned patents  and hes wrong when he says of federal agencies  they dont want therapy to work because then they can vend their vaccine  theres nothing that would prohibit the use of vaccines if there were an effective treatment for covid     neither the world health organization nor the national institutes of health has recommended the use of ivermectin  common anti parasitic medication  in the treatment of covid     merck  the pharmaceutical company that manufactures ivermectin  has similarly noted that there is  n o scientific basis for potential therapeutic effect against covid    from pre clinical studies  no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with covid    disease  and  concerning lack of safety data in the majority of studies  but cole claimed in the video that ivermectin is treatment for covid     he suggested that federal agencies have stifled its use so that they could profit from vaccines  as we explained above  were in farm country  horse country  you know  you give it to your dogs  your cats  your horses  cole said in the video  addressing an audience in idaho  ivermectin is used to treat parasites in animals  but crossover use in humans can be dangerous  while cole may have only been emphasizing the ubiquity of the drug  not suggesting that people should take veterinary medicine  the fda has said that patients have been hospitalized after taking ivermectin intended for horses as interest in the drug as treatment for covid    has grown  ivermectin does have antiviral properties  but the fda hasnt approved it to treat any viral infections  it is being studied with regard to covid     though  according to both the who and nih  treating covid    with ivermectin is still being evaluated in clinical trials  but at present there is not enough evidence to support its use  said shapiro  the harvard professor  my understanding is that the inhibitory dose needed for it to work is extremely high and trying to take enough to suppress the virus could lead to other problems  the trials so far have showed no benefit or worsening disease  some showed shorter time to disease resolution or viral clearance  and some did show possible mortality benefit  but there were problems with most of these trials that include small sample size and different outcome measures and other possible biases  he said  winslow  from stanford  cautioned that there have been many claims for miracle cures over the course of the pandemic and said that ivermectin would need more rigorous study before we know how useful it would be in treating covid     ivermectin truly is wonder drug for parasitic diseases  he said  but my suspicion is that it will be lot like hydroxychloroquine  hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that was touted by former president donald trump as treatment for covid     although studies found that it wasnt an effective treatment and may cause serious side effects in some patients  as weve explained before  the problem with drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine  which are promoted as having broad spectrum antiviral properties  is that the quantity of inhibitor required to effectively kill off the virus also sickens the host cells  winslow said  even potent versions  like remdesivir  which winslow referred to as the gold standard of specific antiviral therapy in covid    treatments  only accelerates the time to recovery  but doesnt significantly reduce death rates or mortality from covid     remdesivir is the only drug approved by the fda to treat covid     the approval is forÂ patients requiring hospitalization  so  coles claim that there is blood on the hands of bureaucrats in washington who have suppressed this life saving medication  is unfounded  ivermectin hasnt been proved to be effective  another of the major points that cole emphasized in the video is the role vitamin d could have in fighting covid     if you do not supplement with vitamin d in the wintertime  you are immune suppressed  most insurance companies in idaho and northern states do not pay for vitamin d test  unfortunately  said cole  whose lab offers several vitamin d tests  after eschewing public health guidelines that recommend staying six feet apart and wearing masks to slow the spread of the virus  cole said  what should public health message number one  two  and three be  vitamin d  vitamin d  vitamin d  its true that vitamin d  which is mostly associated with bone health  plays part in the immune system  but that doesnt mean its panacea for covid     as weve explained before  while lot of basic research points to vitamin d having role in the immune system  it is less clear if these mechanisms are applicable in clinical practice and to what degree they would benefit covid    patients  as weve written  studies assessing whether vitamin d can treat or prevent infectious diseases have generally beenÂ inconsistent  recent article from npr looked at the research on vitamin d with respect to covid    over the last year and found  essentially  the same thing  it also noted that some studies have shown that low vitamin d levels areÂ associated with higherÂ risk of contracting covid    or withÂ becoming seriously ill  while these studies raised hopes among some researchers  others are skeptical  noting that most of these are observational studies  not the gold standard randomized  controlled trials  the story said  much of the available evidence only shows association  not causation  and even those results are mixed  walter willett  professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the harvard t h  chan school of public health  told npr  in september  dr  anthony fauci  the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  said in an instagram live interview that for those who are deficient in vitamin d  i would not mind recommending  and i do it myself  taking vitamin d supplements  but  as we wrote before  excessive doses should not be used,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
source  anonymous  instagram     apr       Â     review  vaccines for covid    became available to the public less than year after the virus was first detected  much faster than any other vaccine development in history  some social media users have used the speed of development to imply that covid    vaccines are unsafe  post on instagram compared it to the lack of success in finding vaccines for the human immunodeficiency virus  hiv   the common cold  and cancer  the central idea of vaccination is to expose persons immune system to marker  or antigen  that will allow it to recognize and defend better against pathogen presenting the same antigen in the future  vaccines for covid    were developed in record time  beating the previous fastest time of four years for mumps vaccine in the     s  however  this is indicative of the unprecedented resources that governments  research funders and companies put towards completing the clinical trials  the u s  government alone invested over     billion through operation warp speed  it is important to keep in mind that the speed of development didnt compromise safety or efficacy testing of the vaccines  the covid    vaccines used in the u s  had to meet the u s  food and drug administrations requirements for safety and efficacy before they could receive emergency use authorization  in vaccine development  there are many stages of testing  these stages can slow down the process of vaccine development as analyzing results  deciding whether to proceed  planning the next stage  acquiring funding  gaining ethical approval  and setting up the clinical trial recruitment sites all take time  because of delays between each testing stage  vaccines can take many years to reach the general public  in the case of the covid    vaccines  many of these stages were done in parallel to speed up the process  for instance  manufacturing plants and large scale clinical trials were being prepared even when the vaccine was still in the early stages of safety testing  the covid    vaccine clinical trials also recruited volunteers quickly  as almost all other clinical trials stopped and the medical community focused its efforts on the pandemic  prior to the pandemic  it could take years to recruit the thousands of people needed for clinical trials  another factor that sped up the clinical trials was the large number of covid    infections circulating in communities around the world  scientists running vaccine clinical trial need to wait until there are enough infections recorded among the participants  then they can analyze the data to see if there are fewer cases  hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccinated group compared to the group who received the placebo  if disease is very rare or slow to develop  then it can take long time to tell if the vaccine was effective or not  in the case of covid     with hundreds of thousands of cases every day worldwide  it didnt take long for the scientists running the clinical trials to record the required number of infections  the covid    vaccines that are authorized in the u s  are based on either rna or viral vector technologies that were developed over many years  these technologies allowed scientists to design the covid    vaccines in matter of weeks once the virus was identified and sequenced  thanks to previous knowledge from the sars and mers outbreaks caused by similar coronaviruses  scientists knew which approaches were likely to be most effective  such as which form of antigen to use  there are currently several effective covid    vaccines in use around the world  however  their success should not be taken for granted  many vaccine candidates failed in testing or are still under development  vaccines created over the last century are very successful in reducing deaths from infectious diseases  the measles vaccine alone is thought to have saved    million lives between      and       while the smallpox vaccine led to the diseases eradication  however  some diseases  such as those referenced in the instagram post  are more difficult to develop an effective vaccine against  the human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  was identified in      and clinical trials for the first hiv vaccine candidate opened three years later  one of the fundamental challenges with hiv is that the human immune system cannot naturally clear the infection  this makes it difficult for scientists to identify an immune response that would protect against hiv infection  whereas vaccines for other diseases rely on triggering similar immune response to an infection  this would not be sufficient for hiv  within days or weeks of infection  hiv integrates its genome into the dna of the human host cell  where it becomes invisible to the immune system and impossible to remove     due to this  there is only brief window of time during which hiv is vulnerable to persons immune system  hiv infects various immune cells and prevents the immune system from fighting the infection  hiv can also mutate rapidly  adding further difficulty to the development of an effective vaccine  even if the immune system of an infected person could generate antibodies targeting the virus  new mutations would allow the virus to become unrecognizable again     there are at least     different strains of rhinoviruses  which is the group of viruses that cause up to    percent of common colds in adults  developing vaccine to protect people against even half of these strains has proved too costly or impractical so far  other viruses that cause the common cold include coronaviruses  adenovirus  parainfluenza viruses  respiratory syncytial virus  and metapneumovirus  respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  can cause serious infections in some people  increasing the risk of pneumonia and death  as described in previous review by health feedback  rsv is the leading respiratory cause of hospitalization in infants and young children in the united states and the world       according to the cdc  over        hospitalizations          emergency department visits and     million outpatient clinic visits among children    years of age are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  infections each year in the united states  rsv associated deaths among children    years of age are thought to be uncommon  estimated at         per year  among us adults  an estimated         hospitalizations and        deaths associated with rsv infections occur annually  however  these are likely underestimates of rsv associated deaths  an effort to develop vaccine against rsv in the     s led to more severe infections among vaccinated children     research since then has identified new approaches that could avoid this problem and there are now several vaccine candidates against rsv in clinical trials that will be closely monitored for safety     most research efforts into cancer focus on improving diagnosis  developing treatments and identifying risk factors  these advances  from new chemotherapies to reductions in smoking  have significantly reduced deaths  after adjusting for age  over the last    years     however  vaccines are effective at preventing some types of cancer  for example  vaccine against human papillomavirus  hpv  prevents most cases of cervical cancer  cancer vaccines are also in the early stages of development as form of treatment  rather than disease prevention  the aim of this new approach is to trigger persons immune system to attack the cancer cells  potentially treating cancers that are currently incurable  the covid    vaccines were created and tested more quickly than any vaccine in history  this was due to advances in vaccine technology  scientists improved understanding of the immune response to viruses  and unprecedented resources that were made available by governments and companies  the covid    vaccines went through the same degree of testing as would be expected of any vaccine to demonstrate their relative efficacy and safety  effective vaccines against some other diseases  such as hiv  are much more difficult to create despite decades of research    coronavirus

people under    who fundamentally have no health risks  theres no scientific rationale for them to ever become vaccinated  dr peter mccullough says in testimony to the senate of the us state of texas around the    minute mark of this video  the video of the march          testimony was shared on facebook by the association of american physicians and surgeons  an organization described on its website as fighting the good fight to preserve the practice of private medicine since       its youtube post of the video has been viewed more than         times  the video was also shared via various websites  and shorter clips of the testimony circulated with french subtitles  the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   health canada and the world health organization all recommend vaccination against covid     as of april          more than         people in the united states and        people in canada have died from covid     multiple covid    vaccines are being administered or are in trials around the world  and inaccurate claims about the shots are spreading across the internet  more than     millionÂ covid    vaccine doses have been administered in the united states Â and     millionÂ have been administered in canada Â  below  afp fact check examines three false claims made by mccullough  the cdc says on its website that risk of severe disease from the novel coronavirus increases with age  but national center for health statistics data shows that people under age    account for four percent of deaths involving covid     and march          article in science also found that by mid august      the resurgence in the united states was largely driven by adults    to    years of age Â  olivier schwartz  head of the virus and immunity unit at the pasteur institute  told afp by phone  it is obvious that people under    who are in good health should be vaccinated because they can still be affected by the disease  bruno lina  professor of virology at the university of lyon Â said that the aimÂ of mass vaccination campaign is to reduce the transmission of virus  this would not be effective if only people over    years old received the vaccine  that is less than half the population  and under these conditions  we will never slow down the circulation of the virus  he said  both schwartz and lina said that while the covid    vaccines currently authorized cannot guarantee that person will not catch the disease  they have been shown to lessen symptoms and prevent death Â  lina also explained that if vaccinated person does contract covid     the amount of virus present compared to an unvaccinated person is    times less  reducing the likelihood of transmission  afp fact check has debunked other claims that vaccination against covid    is unnecessary or should be halted from medical professionals fromÂ texas  canada and belgium  around the    minute mark of his testimony  mccullough claims  people who develop covid have complete and durable immunity Â  he goes on to say  you cant beat natural immunity  you cant vaccinate on top of it and make it better  theres no scientific  clinical or safety rationale for ever vaccinating covid recovered patient  however  an article in the journal bmj found reinfection is possible  lina said that we have the feeling today that the vaccine induces better immunity than certain natural infections  he said that for people with less symptomatic bouts of covid     we observe rapid loss of antibody titer  and therefore potential for reinfection faster than that observed with vaccination  the pasteur institutes schwartz also confirmed that people who have contracted covid    have an interest in being vaccinated because the antibody level decreases in all people  he said boosting antibody levels  even in those vaccinated  will be particularly important against variants which need more antibodies to be neutralized  there are also indications that some people suffering from lingering symptoms of covid     or long covid  have experienced relief after vaccination  mccullough testified  one of the mistakes i heard today as rationale for vaccinations is asymptomatic spread and i want you to be very clear about this    my opinion is there is low degree  if any  of asymptomatic spread  sick person gives it to sick person  the chinese have published study in the british medical journal     million people  theyre trying to find asymptomatic spread  you cant find it  he said  afp examined other misleading claims about this chinese research in an article in january  the study  published in the scientific journal nature  was conducted in the latter half of may      after wuhan relaxed strict lockdown that had been in place for months  fujian song  one of the reports authors  said in an email on january         that  it is misleading incorrect wrong to conclude that all asymptomatic individuals infected with covid    are not infectious  based on the results of the paper  the bmj published report on the research on december          citing the studys authors  it said that the findings cannot be extrapolated to countries where outbreaks have not been brought under control successfully Â  university of lyons lina confirmed that it is incorrect to claim that asymptomatic people cant spread the virus  he explained that

multiple social media posts are using excerpts of uk tv interview with canadian immunologist sir john bell to imply covid    vaccines may cause infertility  one facebook post  shared more than     times since december     suggests in its caption that prof bell blurts out the truth about the vaccine in the video  jon snow  interviewing sir john bell  bell blurts out that this vaccine will sterilise about     of the population and snow  realising what bell has just said live on air  immediately cuts him off  similar clip of the interview was posted on youtube on november    by user who also promotes moon landing conspiracy theories  at the time of writing  it had been viewed more than         times  the videos description reads  believe him  someone who has these levels of credentials doesnt misspeak without correcting himself  i am sure any infertility will be blamed on the virus  clips of the interview segment have also been posted by social media users in australia and new zealand  including by advance nz  political party whose page was previously suspended by facebook for repeatedly sharing covid    misinformation  in its version  the word sterilise is emphasised and the comment freudian slip  added  when prof bell used the word sterilise in the interview  it was not in relation to fertility  the regius professor of medicine at oxford university and former president of the uk academy of medical sciences told aap factcheck he was instead discussing how vaccines sterilise community from covid    by preventing the virus from spreading  i was referring to the ability of the vaccines to completely eliminate viral replication  ie sterilise  and  it  had no relevance to fertility  prof bell told aap factcheck via email  there is currently no evidence any covid    vaccines cause infertility  aap factcheck previously debunked the false suggestion  which was based on the claim that key protein for placenta formulation was also targeted by the immunisations  the clip of prof bell is taken from an interview broadcast on britains channel   news on august           prior to covid    vaccines being approved for emergency use by uk regulators  the interviewer is renowned journalist and presenter jon snow  in answer to question about when covid    vaccines will become available  prof bell talks about the likely effectiveness of vaccines and the need for robust regulatory approval process  from  min   sec in this version of the video from channel     lot of this depends on the intensity of infection  so  in order to get readout  you have to have certain number of incident cases in the control vaccine population  and that then tells you that you can look at the real vaccinated population and see whether theyve been protected  so  im hoping thats going to happen pretty smartly this autumn  but then dont forget  these vaccines are unlikely to completely sterilise the population  theyre very likely to have an effect which works in percentage  say    or    per cent  well have to look quite carefully  and the regulators will have to look quite carefully  to make sure that its done what we need it to do before it gets approved  so  there will be delay between the outcome of the trial and decision whether it can be approved as vaccine  at no point in the interview does prof bell or the interviewer refer to fertility  the post falsely suggests snow immediately cut off prof bell  in reality  the interview continues for around    seconds after the sterilise comment before the veteran broadcaster moves to wrap up the item  the idea that covid    vaccines may cause infertility was advanced by german physician wolfgang wodarg and michael yeadon  former pfizer employee  who asked europes health regulator to delay clinical trials and approval of the pfizer biontech vaccine  the pair incorrectly claimed the vaccine would cause the formation of antibodies against the protein syncytin    which is involved in the development of the placenta  however  as numerous fact checks and many experts have pointed out  see examples here  here and here   mrna vaccines such as those from pfizer biontech and moderna elicit immune responses to spike proteins from the sars cov   virus that bear little relation to syncytin    to help clear up the misunderstanding  group of us reproductive health experts published an journal article in january comparing the vaccine protein and syncytin    the study confirmed there is little homology between the two proteins  they noted the body naturally produced antibodies to the virus protein when people became infected with covid     however there was no indication of increased risk of miscarriage among pregnant women who were diagnosed with the illness  the researchers concluded  to make such baseless claim without any scientific evidence to support this theory elicits unfounded fear in our patient population  and creates an unnecessary sense of hesitancy to receive the covid    vaccine  data from clinical trials undertaken for three major covid    vaccines  from pfizer biontech  moderna and astrazeneca  show there was no significant difference in the rate of pregnancies or miscarriages among vaccinated participants compared with the control groups  professor bell has confirmed to aap factcheck that his comments were about sterilisation from the covid    virus and had nothing to do with fertility  the implication that he said covid    vaccines will cause fertility issues is misleading  there is no evidence to suggest

the covid    vaccines in use are poorly tested experimental vaccines  this is not true  the currently approved covid    vaccines have all been through testing in multiple stages of clinical trials  the reported numbers of cases of covid    are misleading because asymptomatic people with positive test would not normally be counted as case  it is common practice to count case without symptoms for many infectious diseases      of people who test positive for covid wore masks always or often  this comes from study that found slightly higher proportion of people who tested negative wore masks  and were less likely to visit restaurants  where mask wearing is difficult  bill gates is eugenicist who wants to reduce the population of the world  this is not true  mr gates has promoted improved healthcare  which he has said may cause the world population to grow more slowly  viral video on facebook includes number of false and misleading claims about the covid    pandemic Â  the video consists of woman recommending publication in new zealand called the real news  which she summarises and reads from  there are number of false or misleading claims in this video  this article considers some of them  there are many other claims included in the video that we have not checked  which may or may not be true Â  Â  we have written about this topic previously Â  all three of the vaccines that are currently being used in the uk have undergone multiple stages of clinical trials  pfizer astrazeneca and moderna have all released analyses of phase three safety and efficacy data in peer reviewed journals  each including tens of thousands of patients  data on long term protection and safety will continue to be collected over the coming years  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  has previously told full fact  following widespread use of these vaccines across the uk  the vast majority of suspected adverse reaction reports so far confirm the safety profile seen in clinical trials Â  it added  the expected benefits of the vaccines in preventing covid    and serious complications associated with covid    far outweigh any currently known side effects  on   april       the mhra issued statement advising on possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and very rare and specific type of blood clot seen in the context of low platelets  as precaution  because of the balance of risks from covid    for young people  the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has advised that people under the age of    in the uk should be offered an alternative covid    vaccine  in addition  people of any age who are at an increased risk of blood clots should have an individualised risk assessment Â  the article shown in the video also says  historically only patients who demonstrated actual symptoms of an illness were considered case  publishing positive test results as cases  is grossly misleading and needlessly alarming  this is misleading Â  professor of health protection with specialism in medical microbiology  professor paul hunter  told full fact  we often do count asymptomatic infections for other infectious diseases especially where asymptomatic individuals pose risk to others as is the case with covid  he also cautioned that this is important because for covid the big issue is that truly asymptomatic people can still and do transmit the infection  case is classified by case definition which sets the criteria for the diagnosis of condition or infection  case definition may include clinical criteria  symptoms   laboratory testing  and sometimes specific epidemiological stipulations on time period or location Â  somebody may test positive for an infectious disease long before having symptoms  and this would be considered case  other examples of infectious conditions that may be asymptomatic but would be considered case after positive test include certain forms of hepatitis  malaria  forms of polio  varicella zoster  which causes chicken pox  Â  public health england uses the following case definition for counting confirmed covid    cases in england  covid    cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the sars cov   virus  if the test is positive  this is referred to as case  testing asymptomatic people for infection  and counting them as case if they test positive is not unusual practice Â  Â  this claim has been previously fact checked by reuters Â  it comes from paper from the us centers for disease control and prevention  which did show that both     of positive covid    cases and     of people who tested negative reported wearing masks always or often Â  the study was not designed to investigate the impact of mask wearing in general on transmission of covid  its focus was on the risks of going to places where masks are difficult to use  it found that similar proportions of people with and without covid went shopping  which may be easy to do with mask  in the two weeks before becoming ill  on the other hand      of people testing positive for covid    went to restaurant  where masks are difficult to wear  compared with only     of the people who tested negative Â  cdc spokesperson  jason mcdonald  told reuters  the aim of the study was to assess possible situations for community exposure  not mask use  the study  mcdonald noted  found that going to places where mask use and social distancing cannot be maintained might be an important risk factor for covid     there is some evidence that surgical masks and face coverings can reduce transmission of covid     the potential benefit of mask wearing has also been demonstrated for other respiratory viruses Â  Â  bill gates has been the subject of many covid    conspiracy theories  common claim is that bill gates is using vaccinations to reduce the worlds population and enact eugenics programme Â  this has been previously fact checked by reuters and snopes and originates from claims that mr gates said that three billion people need to die  and that his dad ran planned parenthood Â  mr gates was alleged to have said three billion people need to die by man speaking at the international tribunal for natural justice  there is no evidence that mr gates ever said this  what he did say  in ted talk in       was that Â  the world today has     billion people  that s headed up to about nine billion  now  if we do really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps     or    percent  but there  we see an increase of about       the talk was about reducing global carbon dioxide emissions to zero  it was not describing plan to use vaccinations to kill people  in fact  his hope for vaccinations is quite the oppositethat good healthcare would lower the risk of death  thereby encouraging parents to have fewer children  this is about slowing the growth of the world population  not reducing the population that exists now  in an article in forbes in       mr gates said that whilst his initial work in public health focused on contraception  he switched focus to vaccinations  when it became clear that reduced mortality rates and better childhood survival allows individuals to make the choice to reduce their family size  and therefore reduces birth rates Â  full fact has

widely shared meme features covid    vaccine q that includes series of claims  including that the inoculations skipped crucial testing stages  contain cells from foreign sources and cause serious harm

among the claims are that covid    vaccines have not been safety tested on animals  the astra zeneka  sic  and johnson   johnson vaccines contain aborted human or monkey cells  doctors have concerns about the mrna vaccines long term effect on fertility  the vaccines increased the risk of auto immune diseases and that the vaccines have caused deaths or injuries  the meme has been shared by several australian users and across range of platforms  including facebook  twitter  telegram  reddit and instagram  while some of the checklists entries are based in fact  it also contains significant misinformation  wrongly claiming  for example  that covid    vaccines did not undergo animal trials and that they contain monkey or aborted human cells  in the us  the food and drug administration has authorised the pfizer biontech  moderna and johnson   johnson janssen covid    vaccines for emergency use  while the european medicines agency has also authorised use of astrazenecas vaccine  in australia  the therapeutic goods administration  tga  has provisionally approved the pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines for use  as stated in the meme  astrazenecas vaccine does contain genetically modified organisms  gmos   while mrna based vaccines  such as those from pfizer and moderna  have been described as experimental in trials  although researchers have been studying the technology for decades  in addition  aap factcheck investigated number of the postss questionable claims  have the vaccines been safety tested on animals Â  the meme states the covid    vaccines have not been safety tested on animals  however this is false  vaccines go through multiple stages of trials to assess their safety and efficacy  and each of the four aforementioned companies tested their candidates on animals before they were approved for human use  the pfizer mrna vaccine was tested on mice and rhesus macaque monkeys  modernas vaccine was also tested on rhesus macaques  the astrazeneca vaccine undertook preclinical trials in rhesus macaques and mice and janssens candidate was tested on macaque monkeys and golden hamsters  all the animal trials found the vaccine candidates demonstrated protection against the sars cov   virus  do the astrazeneca and johnson   johnson vaccines contain monkey or aborted human cells Â  as previously explained by aap factcheck  laboratory made cell lines derived from single aborted fetus in the     s were used during the development of astrazenecas covid    vaccine  however  the final vaccine formulation does not contain cells of any kind  the janssen vaccine also uses laboratory made cells descended from fetus that was electively aborted in       however  the vaccine then goes through several purification steps  janssen anz spokeswoman told aap factcheck in an email there is no fetal tissue of either animal or human origin in the vaccine  both the pfizer and moderna mrna based vaccines use fetal cell lines for confirmation tests to ensure the inoculations function correctly  however neither use these cells for manufacturing nor do the inoculations contain fetal cells  regarding monkey cells  the university of oxford says astrazenecas vaccine uses weakened common cold virus which usually infects chimpanzees as its vector  spokeswoman for astrazeneca told aap factcheck via email the vaccine uses virus cells which cant replicate in humans  but there is nothing from another species in the formulation  do doctors have concerns about mrna vaccines long term effect on fertility  aap factcheck has previously debunked claims that mrna vaccines could lead to recipients becoming infertile  the claim was advanced by former pfizer employee and german physician who said the vaccine would induce antibodies against proteins such as syncytin    which is involved in the development of the placenta in humans  however  an article published in the british medical journal in february detailed advice from the association of reproductive and clinical scientists and the british fertility society which refutes any link between the vaccines and fertility  spokeswoman for pfizer told aap factcheck in an email there is no data to suggest that the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine causes infertility and pointed to advice from the australian governments department of health  tga assessment report  page     and the cdc  pregnancies were reported by participants who received the vaccine during both the pfizer  page     and moderna  page     clinical trials  is there risk of autoimmune disease  strokes  seizures  convulsions or other side effects  there is no data available on the safety of covid    vaccines for people already experiencing autoimmune conditions such as arthritis and multiple sclerosis  as highlighted by the cdc  nevertheless  as explained by health authorities  such as the department of health  there is no evidence to suggest the vaccines can cause these conditions  university of western australia associate professor archa fox  an expert in rna biology  wrote in the conversation that it wasnt clear where the myth linking autoimmune diseases to mrna vaccines came from  but the short lived nature of mrna made an autoimmune trigger from these vaccines highly unlikely  she said  tga spokesperson told aap factcheck in an email that autoimmune diseases  stroke  seizures and convulsions are not recognised adverse effects of either of the covid    vaccines approved for use in australia  however  authorities have highlighted evidence that the astrazeneca vaccine may cause rare but serious cases of blood clotting in the brain  leading countries such as australia and the uk to limit its use among younger recipients  the exact relationship between the vaccine and condition was not known as of april    have the vaccines caused deaths or injuries Â  national and international drug regulators have found no conclusive evidence of any deaths caused by covid    vaccines  these include the cdc  european medicines agency  uk government and tga  meanwhile  who update on march    stated no cases of deaths have been found to have been caused by covid    vaccines as of march         after more than     million doses of the vaccines were administered  tga spokesperson told aap factcheck in march    statement  none of the deaths reported to us to date are thought to be caused by vaccination  many people vaccinated so far in australia have been older  with pre existing medical conditions  older age and underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events  including deaths  will occur  nevertheless  european regulators have indicated small number of deaths among astrazeneca vaccine recipients due to blood clots may be linked to the vaccine  see here and here   although the casual connection remains unproven  while the post contains some true statements  such as about the presence of gmos in some vaccines  it also contains several falsehoods  it wrongly claims that covid    vaccines havent been safety tested on animals  the moderna  pfizer  janssen and astrazeneca vaccines all completed animal trials  similarly  no fetal or animal cells are present in any of the vaccines  contrary to the posts suggestion  experts and authorities also say there is no evidence to support claims that vaccines negatively affect fertility or increase the risk of autoimmune diseases  while there is also no conclusive proof any of the immunisations have led to deaths  partly false  content that has some factual inaccuracies

different video published earlier this year  see our debunk of that video here  for that story  we reached out to dr  douglas drevets  an infectious disease specialist at the oklahoma university health sciences center  in an email to lead stories  dated february           he said about tenpenny   s he really does not understand how the mrna vaccines work  for example  she states that after injection  the mrna replicates   which it does not   and that we make an antibody against the mrna   which we do not  and that anti spike protein antibodies will bind to the lung and damage it   which they do not  in the new video  at   minutes     seconds  the narrator claims  the antibody that comes in response to the spike protein that s in the covid vaccine  do you know what it does  it kills the type two macrophages  so the body is literally in constant state of high inflammation  creating cytokine storm  there s no evidence that s true  prof  timothy brewer  ucla david geffen school of medicine infectious disease researcher who also treats covid patients  told lead stories for february           debunk that his literature search found no reports of surge of lethal  cytokine storm  deaths caused by mrna vaccines  at    minutes     seconds  the narrator  whose credentials are not provided  discusses the astrazeneca vaccine  claiming that it contains the  dna of an aborted child   she said  is it possible then that our dna  our genetic structure  may be modified  lead stories has addressed both of those claims before  there s no evidence mrc   cells  which are replications of lung tissue cells taken from an aborted male fetus in       are in the vaccine itself  also  the u s  food and drug administration  fda  defines gene therapy as modification of person s genes to treat or cure disease  which is not what mrna vaccination does  see our debunks of those claims here and here  around the    minute mark  the narrator starts making allegations about the covid    vaccine developed by moderna  she says that it s  not vaccine  and  later  that it s  purely experimental   neither statement is true  as we ve previously reported  both the pfizer and moderna injections are correctly called vaccines  per the definition of vaccine from the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   see our story here  also  given that both shots have been field tested and given emergency use authorization  eua  by the fda  they are no longer experimental  as we reported here  at    minutes     seconds  the narrator says about the vaccines  it s not going to prevent death or prevent hospitalization  or prevent you from being contagious or prevent you from getting other symptoms of covid  so explain to me  why should we put this experimental drug into our bodies  knowing the risks are so high and the benefits are so small  those statements are also false  all the vaccines currently available in the united states are effective at preventing covid     according to the cdc  of course  that doesn t mean it s impossible to contract the disease after being vaccinated  but getting the shot dramatically lowers your chances  vaccination also helps protect people from getting severely ill with covid     if they still get the virus  and it may also help protect those around them by reducing the amount of virus they cough or breathe out  the cdc recommends that people get covid    vaccine as soon as they become eligible,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
as coronavirus cases rise in the country  the upsurge has become cause of concern for the authorities  at the same time  misinformation regarding the vaccines is spreading rapidly on social media platforms  in one such post  video of an unrecognised doctor making various unverified claims about coronavirus and covid    vaccines has gone viral on social media  the video can be seen here  here and here   fact check newsmobile fact checked this post and found it to be false and misleading  in the video  the doctor was seen making series of claims  first  he says  coronavirus is not an epidemic  but normal flu and an international conspiracy  every informed citizen is aware that coronavirus  which was first discovered in      in china  has spread across the world and has claimed lakhs of lives till now  as per the recent johns hopkins university tracker  around             people have contracted the virus till now and approximately           people have succumbed to it so far   the world health organization declared coronavirus as pandemic on march           last year  and the world is still largely battered by it   in his second claim  he says that the test being done to detect coronavirus is faulty and is scam  we investigated this claim and found that the tests being done by the centre to detect coronavirus  rt pcr and rapid antigen test  are verified by the ministry of health and indian council of medical research  moreover  we also found this news article published by dna which explained  that rt pcr test is test in which  small amount of dna is taken through swab from the test candidate  which is then used to amplify specific sequences of the genetic material and diagnose if there is an infection  the swab can either be nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal  which means it can be sampled from both the nose and the throat  this sample is then sent for the rt pcr test  which includes many steps to convert the rna into viral dna  this test is specific to check for covid    infection alone  if person tests positive  it means that they have covid      in his third claim  the doctor in the video says that the coronavirus vaccine contains cells from animal sources  cow and pig  and the same has been said by serum institute ceo adar poonawalla  during our investigation we found the fact sheet shared by serum institute of india  which mentions the ingredients of the vaccine  the list of the ingredients do not mention the use of pig fat or cow cells   the vaccine produced by bharat biotech  covaxin  has also released itsÂ ingredients and it does not mention the use of pig fat or cow cells in them  we also could not find any such statement made by adar poonawalla on any news platform which corroborates the claim  you can find more about coronavirus misinformationÂ here  hence with the above information it is clear that all claims in the above video are false and misleading,[0. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

the corona vaccine is not safe or effective  false  clinical trials have shown that vaccines for covid    work and are safe  the coronavirus vaccines have been produced too quickly to be safe  false  the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective  the vaccine will change your dna  false  some of the coronavirus vaccines use mrna  which instructs the body on how to build immune proteins called antibodies against sars cov    the virus that causes covid      they do not change  or interact with your dna  the vaccine could cause women and girls to become infertile  there is no evidence to support this  covid    kills roughly the same number of people as flu  false  the death toll from covid    far exceeds that from seasonal flu  covid    is not pandemic  false  covid    was declared pandemic by the world health organisation in march       pcr tests should not be used to diagnose covid     pcr tests are the gold standard way to test for covid     and are very effective  the vaccine is experimental  the vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would  video on social media  featuring four people who state they are healthcare professionals  includes number of false claims about covid    vaccines  the clip has been taken from longer video which has been circulating on social media for while Â  in the uk  three covid    vaccines have been approved for use made by pfizer  moderna and astrazeneca  all of these vaccines have been found to be safe and effective  in clinical trials the pfizer vaccine was     effective  meaning the number of infections among people who were given the vaccine was     lower than the number in the group that wasnt Â  while mild to moderate side effects such as nausea  tiredness and pain around the injection site  are common  these tend to pass quickly Â  the moderna vaccine reduced cases of symptomatic covid    by     and all cases of severe covid    occurred in the group who were not vaccinated Â  like the pfizer vaccine  the moderna vaccine commonly produced mild or moderate side effects which passed quickly  but the rate of severe side effects was similar in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups Â  the vaccines may cause allergic reactions and so people with history of allergic reactions  especially to any of the ingredients  should inform healthcare staff beforehand Â Â  the latest data on the astrazeneca vaccine shows it reduces the rate of symptomatic covid    by      and is      effective against severe or critical covid    and hospitalisation  previous safety data showed the rate of serious adverse events was no higher in the group which received this covid    vaccine than the control group  who either received meningitis vaccine or saline solution  the covid    vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines  there are good reasons for this  for one  lot of the groundwork had already been done  years of developing mrna vaccine technology and working on vaccines against other coronaviruses like sars meant researchers had headstart with covid    vaccines Â  the astrazeneca vaccine is not an mrna vaccine  but uses technique that had already been successfully used to vaccinate against other infections Â  money was also factor  lot of the time it takes to develop vaccines is spent waiting for funding  with covid     the global need for vaccine was so great that funding was more accessible than usual Â  nevertheless  the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective Â  the claim that vaccines will change your dna is false  and has its roots in the fact that some of the covid    vaccines  including the pfizer vaccine  contain mrna  which is chemically similar to dna Â  the mrna in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the sars cov   virus  the virus which causes covid    Â  this  in turn  prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that  if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus  they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus  but this rna doesnt come into contact with human dna  which is stored in the nucleus of cells  let alone change it  even if it could enter the nucleus  it cant merge with human dna or get converted in dna  weve fact checked similar claims several times before  the british fertility society says  there is absolutely no evidence  and no theoretical reason  that any of the vaccines can affect the fertility of women or men  weve written about this several times before Â  the nhs also says that anyone planning to get pregnant doesnt need to avoid the vaccine  we have written many times about the differences between covid    and seasonal flu in terms of mortality  the deaths caused by covid    in the period between january      and march      are far greater than the deaths caused by flu for the same period Â  data from the office for national statistics  ons  for england and wales shows that         people died with covid    as the underlying cause of death  compared to        people dying with flu and pneumonia as the underlying cause of death between january      up to march      Â  we do not yet have the figures for       but for      for flu alone  excluding pneumonia   this figure was much smaller  and was the direct cause of       deaths Â       saw far fewer cases of flu than previous years  and so perhaps isnt fair comparison  however  figures from public health england  phe  for the last five years show that there were        deaths per year on average associated with flu in england  the year with the highest number of deaths in that period was            when there were        deaths associated with flu  this is far fewer than the number we have seen over the past year directly caused by  or even related to covid     the definition of pandemic is an epidemic occurring worldwide  or over very wide area  crossing international boundaries and usually affecting large number of people Â  the covid    crisis meets this criteria  and covid    was declared pandemic by the world health organisation in march      Â  weve checked similar claims before Â  although some have claimed that the inventor of the polymerase chain reaction  kary b mullis  who died before the pandemic  said that pcr tests could not detect infections  this is mis quote Â  confusion seems to have arisen from quotes of his in      article about hiv and aids  the author actually quotes dr mullis as saying quantitative pcr is an oxymoron within the context of testing viral load  the amount of virus present  in people with hiv  this doesnt mean he thought pcr testing didnt work at all  but that there are limitations in detecting the specific levels of virus from sample using pcr testing  pcr is the gold standard test for sars cov   as mandated by the world health organisation  who  and public health england  phe   like all tests  there are some false negatives and false positive results associated with pcr testing  however overall it is thought to be very effective  we have previously written about how pcr tests work  and how effective they are  two of the vaccines approved for use in the uk are mrna vaccines  the pfizer and moderna vaccines   while these are the first mrna vaccines to be rolled out to the general public  the technology behind mrna vaccines has been developed over number of years Â Â  both mrna covid    vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine

by vanden bossche  have been shared tens of thousands of times on facebook and instagram in the united states  canada  austria  romania  belgium  ireland  germany  italy  france  the czech republic and others  russian state controlled news organization rt also spreadÂ the claims in german  vanden bossche  who is trained in veterinary medicine  claims that widespread and stringent infection prevention measures combined with mass vaccination campaigns using inadequate vaccines will undoubtedly lead to situation where the pandemic is getting increasingly out of control in process called viral immune escape  he says that infection prevention measures such as lockdowns have suppressed innate immunity in young people and that covid    antibodies  which can be generated naturally or by vaccines  are limited and short lived Â  mass vaccination during the pandemic  he says  will lead to monster variants when the virus spreads from older people to those who are younger  as countries begin loosening restrictions  some of his claims have also been spread by prominent anti vaccine advocates del bigtree  robert f  kennedy jr  and his non profit organization childrens health defence  afp fact check has previously reported on misinformation spread by bigtree and kennedy  facebook  instagram and youtube have removed some accounts linked to kennedy and bigtree for spreading inaccurate information  several covid    vaccines are being administered or are in trials around the world  someÂ     million total doses have been administered in the united states  while nearlyÂ    percent of canadians have received at least one dose of covid    vaccine  below  afp fact check examines some of vanden bosschesÂ false and misleading claims  vanden bossche claims that large scale vaccinations of elderly populations will force the virus to continue causing disease in younger age groups  where it could undergo targeted mutations in the spike protein that would enhance its infectiousness  gary mclean  professor of molecular immunology at london metropolitan university  told afp that rather than creating monster as vanden bossche suggests  mutations in the spike protein may hinder the spread of the virus  mutations are relatively subtle in spike and cannot go so far as suggested otherwise they will no longer resemble spike  he said  adding the virus will lose its way of infecting cells if spike continues to mutate and the virus will die out  additionally  variants of the virus emerged prior to the widespread availability of vaccines Â  of the current known variants  three are particularly worrying because of their increased transmissibility and or virulence are those initially detected in southeast england  south africa and in travelers from brazil arriving in japan  this video explains how virus mutates Â   experts say it is crucial to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible in order to limit the risk of new variants emerging  we are not forcing the virus into younger people by vaccinating the elderly  john wherry  director of the perelman school of medicines institute for immunology at the university of pennsylvania said  adding that data from israel does not support vanden bossches claim  an israel health ministry study of more than million people    more than    percent of whom were under       found high levels of vaccine effectiveness  there was no evidence that high vaccination rates in the elderly led to new variants  as predicted by vanden bossche Â  joe grove  virologist at the institute of immunity and transplantation at university college london  explained that even though vaccination could drive some virus changes  it is not credible that widespread immunity will drive the emergence of monster virus Â  if were worried about the covid    becoming some super virus  the best way to stop that is to stop it from replicating and the best way to do that is vaccines  he added  this was also confirmed by scott halperin  director of the canadian centre for vaccinology  if we rapidly achieve high levels of population immunity through vaccination  the risk of variant emergence is decreased because there are insufficient numbers of susceptible individuals to continue the propagation of the virus and spread through the community  he said  there can be no doubt that lack of exposure due to stringent containment measures implemented as of the beginning of the pandemic has not been beneficial to keeping peoples innate immune system well trained  says vanden bossche  wherry called that statement flat out false Â  there is no evidence of this whatsoever  if this were true  wed see major rise in infections due to environment and commensal bacteria and other germs because our innate immune system is weakened  this has absolutely not happened  he said  this was confirmed byÂ grove  that is completely incorrect  the idea that lockdowns and the associated reduction in exposure to everyday bugs will have meant that the innate immune system has lost its fitness  is fundamental misunderstanding of how the immune system works  he said  vanden bossche goes further  suggesting that its important  indeed  to keep it sufficiently exposed to environmental challenges  implying that our innate immunity is only well trained if it is regularly exposed to bugs or viruses  wherry described this as not only incorrect and misunderstanding of how immunology works  but flat out dangerous advice  this was echoed by grove  who said  like smoke alarm has been built to detect smoke  the innate immune system has been built to detect viruses and doesnt need to be trained  vanden bossche claims that the increase in s  spike  specific antibodies  which can beÂ  generated by covid    infection or vaccines  is rather limited and only short lived  he does not indicate what he means by short lived  this is incorrect  said wherry  initial studies claiming that antibodies waned rapidly have not held up over time  antibodies look pretty durable  at least over the one to three year time frame Â  beyond that span  grove said  the body is still capable of fighting off the virus  antibodies will circulate in your blood for months and years after vaccination infection  but may stop being produced eventually  however  your antibody factories  b cells  remember how to make them and are on standby for the next time you encounter the virus  therefore  even if you are reinfected your immune system will kick in to fight it off  maybe even before you have symptoms  danny altmann  professor of immunology at imperial college london  was also optimistic about the vaccines in use  he said that the current vaccines are among the most immunogenic ive ever witnessed  logs above the level induced by natural infection  early data for the moderna vaccine showed that both maintained antibody levels for at least three months  recent cdc study showed that the moderna and pfizer mrna vaccines reduced the risk of infection by    percent two or more weeks after vaccination  on his linkedin profile  vanden bossche lists previous roles at number of recognised health organizations

by catalina jaramillo posted on march            updated on may          social media posts repeatedly misuse unverified data from the vaccine adverse event reporting system to falsely claim that covid    vaccines are dangerous  and even lethal  but the government database is not designed to determine if vaccines cause health problems  no vaccine or medical product is      safe  but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval  followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects  in addition  the food and drug administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high quality and free of contaminants  one key vaccine safety surveillance program is the vaccine adverse event reporting system  or vaers  which is an early warning system run by the centers for disease control and prevention and fda  as its website explains  vaers is not designed to detect if vaccine caused an adverse event  but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring closer look  anyone can submit report to vaers for any health problem that occurs after an immunization  there is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem  the information is still valuable because its way of being quickly alerted to potential safety issue with vaccine  which can then be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people  which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts  revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks  the cdc and fda vaccine safety monitoring systems  which were expanded for the covid    vaccines and also include new smartphone based reporting tool called v safe  have subsequently identified only few  very rare adverse events Â  for more  see how safe are the vaccines  link to this all of the authorized vaccines are effective at preventing symptomatic disease  according to the results of the phase   trials  the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines had an efficacy of     or higher  which means your approximate risk of getting sick is cut by     or more if you are vaccinated  its important to keep in mind that the effectiveness of the vaccines outside the controlled setting of clinical trial is typically somewhat lower  study by the centers for disease control and prevention found these two vaccines were     effective in real world conditions  two weeks after the second dose  and     effective two weeks after the first dose  the study monitored       health care personnel  first responders and other essential workers for    weeks Â  Â  johnson   johnsons phase   trial began in late september  nearly two months after the pfizer and moderna trials and shortly before new variant of the coronavirus emerged in south africa  globally  j j reported an efficacy of       in preventing moderate to severe covid    and an efficacy of       in preventing severe or critical covid     but efficacy was higher in the u s  population      efficacy in preventing moderate to severe disease and       efficacy in preventing severe or critical disease  than in south africa      and       efficacy in preventing moderate to severe or severe critical disease  respectively   data from the moderna trial also demonstrate that the vaccine protects against severe covid     the pfizer biontech vaccine probably does as well  but because so few participants in that trial developed severe covid     this hasnt yet been conclusively shown  the j j trial showed      efficacy in preventing covid    that would require medical intervention  meaning hospitalization  icu admission  mechanical ventilation or life support machine  although the trials show the vaccines protect against symptomatic disease  what is still unknown is whether these vaccines protect against infection with the coronavirus  and if not  whether they can prevent someone from spreading the virus to others   see our video on the distinction between virus and disease   however  the cdc has said that growing body of evidence suggests those who are fully vaccinated are potentially less likely to transmit sars cov   to others  link to this millions of people in the united states have safely received covid    vaccines Â  over     million doses had been administered as of march     according to the centers for disease control and prevention  and over    million people had received at least one dose of the vaccine Â  most of those who have reported side effects have said they were minor  such as pain or swelling at the injection site  headaches  chills or fever Â which are all consistent with the results of clinical trials  some people have no side effects at all  and small number of people    to   people per million vaccinated  have reported severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis  which almost always happens within half an hour of being vaccinated  the cdc says Â  yet over and over websitesÂ and social media posts improperly cite unverified raw data from the vaccine adverse event reporting system  an alert system managed by the cdc and the food and drug administration to detect possible safety issues in vaccines  as evidence that the approved covid    vaccines cause deaths and serious events Â  take this instagram video  seen by over        users  in the video  female narrator walks viewers through the vaers website and shows them how to find adverse reactions reported to the database after people received the covid    vaccines Â  acute myocardial infarction  that is stroke  if you guys arent aware of what that means  she says incorrectly at the      mark  as she scrolls down through the results  myocardial infarction is heart attack Â  and couple of minutes later  death  and here we are yall Â  this is exactly what you guys wanted to see  death  patient passed away in her sleep  look at all these deaths you guys  the narrator says scrolling down through dozens of death reports Â  do your own research  writes the account owner on the post  man under the name truth bombs  who in second similar post says hes not scientist or doctor but concerned father  patriot and digital soldier  there are very serious side effect from getting the vaccines  heres your proof  except  as the vaers website warns  any report submitted to the database is not documentation that vaccine caused the event Â  as weve explained before  anyone can submit report of an event to vaers  even if its not clear that vaccine caused the problem  all reports are accepted into the database without determining whether the event was caused by particular vaccine  and therefore  as disclaimer warns  submissions may include incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental and unverified information Â  one of the main limitations of vaers data is that it cannot determine if the vaccine caused the reported adverse event  reads its website  this limitation has caused confusion in the publicly available data from vaers wonder  specifically regarding the number of reported deaths  there have been instances where people have misinterpreted reports of deaths following vaccination as deaths caused by the vaccines  that is not accurate  so when vaers says it has received       reports of death among people who received covid    vaccine as of march     that does not mean that those deaths were caused by the vaccine Â  in fact  after reviewing medical records  autopsies and death certificates for all of those cases  physicians from both the cdc and the fda determined that there was no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths  the vaccine adverse event reporting system is national early warning system to detect possible safety issues in vaccines established by the department of health and human services in      Â  the main goal of the database is to serve as signaling system for adverse reactions  or events  that were not detected during the clinical trials or before vaccine entered the market  it also complies with national childhood vaccine injury act requirement for vaccine manufacturers to report all adverse events and health care providers to report specific adverse events following the administration of vaccine Â  vaers accepts all reports of suspected adverse events  in all age groups  patients  parents and caregivers are encouraged to report any clinically important medical event or health problem that occurs after vaccination  even if theyre not sure if it was result of the vaccine  these reactions may or may not been caused by vaccine Â  these reports create public national database that allows government scientists  and others  to rapidly detect unusual and unexpected patterns that later can be analyzed Â  it generates perhaps the most rapid type of signal if there was something really awful going on  dr  susan s  ellenberg  professor of biostatistics  medical ethics and health policy at the university of pennsylvanias perelman school of medicine  told us Â  as described on its website  vaers can detect new  unusual or rare reactions to vaccines  monitor increases in known side effects  assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines  and identify other possible safety issues Â  dr  walter orenstein  associate director of the emory vaccine center in atlanta  who directed the cdcs immunization program from      to       told us that vaers unique capacity of generating timely signals makes it an extremely important tool Â  it is the best signal generator  he said  we may miss signals without vaers  orenstein said vaers was very helpful in       for example  when it detected safety issue with the first rotavirus vaccine  rotashield  as it was being associated with type of bowel obstruction in infants called intussusception  after the cases were reviewed  the cdc withdrew its recommendation for that vaccine  and the manufacturer took it off the market Â Â  more recently  as explained in      study co authored by scientists from the cdc and fda  vaers detected unusual reporting for febrile seizures in young children following flu shot during the           season  after those episodes  the cdc started listing febrile seizures as possible side effect of some vaccines for infants and children up to   years old  although vaers is great at creating alerts for researchers to follow up  experts agree the database has multiple weaknesses Â  the biggest limitation is it usually cannot help us assess causation  it provides signals  orenstein said Â  as we said  everyone is encouraged to report any medical event or health problem  even if theyre not sure it was caused by vaccine  the event may have been caused by an underlying medical condition  by medication or drug taken at the same time  or simply by chance Â  when vaers detects something unusual  those signals are investigated by scientists and other vaccine surveillance systems  such as the vaccine safety datalink  collaboration between the cdcs immunization safety office and nine health care organizations  or the cdcs clinical immunization safety assessment project  network of vaccine safety experts  including those at seven medical research centers  to evaluate causality  in the case of covid    vaccines  vaers is just one of several vaccine safety monitoring systems the government has in place Â  according to november      vaers report  less than     of all the events reported to the database describe serious events  such as hospitalizations  life threatening illnesses  or deaths  when death is reported  the agency collects information  including medical records  autopsy reports and death certificates  and qualified physician determines the cause of death  just because somebody reports death doesnt mean that the vaccine caused the death  so we dont use vaers to determine death rates or anything concerning death  cdc spokesperson told us previously Â  the vast majority of events reported for covid    vaccines havent been serious Â  in the latest safety update presented by the cdcs vaccine safety team to the advisory committee on immunization practices on march    dr  tom shimabukuro reported that as of feb          of the reports submitted to vaers after the administration of the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines were for non serious events such as headaches  fever  chills and fatigue  the reports of serious events  such as anaphylaxis  heart attacks and strokes  were assessed by vaccine surveillance systems  except for cases of anaphylaxis  which were rare  the cdc reported no safety concerns were detected  meaning there was no cause and effect relationship between the vaccines and the reported adverse events Â Â  people die  unfortunately  without vaccination  orenstein told us  the issue is to determine where the vaccine enhances that risk of death and not  and thats why we have this very careful system  he said the fact that vaers doesnt determine causation is difficult for people to understand  despite all the disclaimers on its website and brochures Â  there is natural human tendency  plus it has served us well  if event b follows event  then event caused event b  i mean  we dont need scientific study to know if you jump out of plane without parachute  youre going to be in trouble  orenstein said  i think the issue here is the clinical syndromes that are occurring and  are being  reported to vaers can also occur without vaccine  and thats what complicates things  the fact that vaers cannot assess causality is not its only weakness Â  its the worst possible data that you could possibly imagine because theres so many uncertainties about it  said ellenberg  who analyzed vaers data for    years as director of the fdas office of biostatistics and epidemiology in the center for biologics evaluation and research  one of the major problems  she said  is that theres no control group to study because unvaccinated people do not report adverse events to vaers  therefore  theres no way to determine if the number of reported events is different from the number that would have been observed without vaccination Â  take the       reports of death filed to vaers as of march     which represent         of those who had received covid    vaccine  people die every day for any number of reasons  in       for example       of the u s  population died from any cause  according to the cdc  that was before the coronavirus pandemic Â  youre going to have deaths that had nothing to do with the vaccines  ellenberg told us Â  deaths unrelated to covid    occurred during the vaccine clinical trials  she said  so she expected to see deaths unrelated to the vaccines among the general population  especially considering that older people and people with underlying medical conditions are getting vaccinated first  another issue  ellenberg said  is the accuracy and completeness of the data because anything that anybody reports goes into the database  person could file report omitting important details  such as which vaccine they got  or someone could even report false event  or report an event without having received vaccine in the first place  although filing false vaers report intentionally is violation of federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment  so you know  if somebody reports that they went skiing and broke their leg  and you know  two years before they had gotten flu shot  they could report that to vaers  she said Â  as experts have told us before  reports to vaers tend to increase when theres more awareness of the vaccine or more publicity around specific side effects  for example  ellenberg said  there was an increase in the number of vaers reports following approval of lyme disease vaccine in the late     s and class action lawsuit against the vaccine manufacturer  which withdrew the vaccine from the market even though the adverse event rate was not shown to be elevated among vaccine recipients  according to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases Â  vaers data arent meant to allow safety comparisons between vaccines  but multiple social media posts make such false comparisons anyway  as disclaimer on the vaers website states  the number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence  severity  frequency  or rates of problems associated with vaccines  other limitations include underreporting  when people dont report serious events happening after vaccines  in addition  it is often the case that more than one vaccine was administered  making it difficult to know to which of the vaccines the event might be attributed  the vaers user guide says  experts agree that even with all of vaers weaknesses  having system with the potential for identifying new adverse effects and signals that can be followed up with more data is still worth having  thats especially true in cases when an emergency use authorization has been issued  and there has been less time to monitor possible adverse events before vaccine gets on the market Â  because of the urgency of the ongoing pandemic  the fda required at least two months of follow up data on half or more of the participants in phase   clinical trials for covid    vaccine to get an emergency use authorization  as weve explained  full licensure requires aÂ minimum of six months  though experts say theres little reason to think more time would uncover safety concerns  there are people who have said vaers  and those kinds of systems are worthless  we shouldnt even bother with them  ellenberg said  i dont agree with that  update  may     after investigating    cases of rare clotting condition out of nearly   million johnson   johnson vaccinations  the cdc and food and drug administration are warning of suggested increased risk of the dangerous condition  which occurred in women and resulted in three deaths as of april     the cdc says women younger than    years old especially should be aware of the rare risk

on march           video that featured freshman member of congress was republished by the right wing watch twitter account  in the video  u s  rep  marjorie taylor greene  georgian who had been no stranger to controversy  purportedly referred to the idea of vaccine passport as bidens mark of the beast  marjorie taylor greene says that vaccine passport is  biden s mark of the beast  and that any company the requires one is engaging in  corporate communism   pic twitter com xttvqw  tu  right wing watch   rightwingwatch  march           its true that greene said that vaccine passport was bidens mark of the beast  she tweeted the same phrase the day before  they are actually talking about peoples ability to buy and sell linked to the vaccine passport  they might as well call it bidens mark of the beast   marjorie taylor greene    mtgreenee  march           the phrase mark of the beast was also trending on twitter  according to dictionary com  the biblical phrase has two meanings  the first is  the mark put on the forehead of those who worship the beast  the antichrist  and symbol of opposition to god  it can also be defined as the stain of apostasy  regarded as both indelible and inescapable  from revelation           in the republished video  greene also purportedly referred to the idea of vaccine passport as corporate communism  read her relevant remarks in the following transcript  they want you to be required to have something called covid passport  and this would mandate your ability to be able to travel  your ability to be able to go to events  your ability to be able to buy and sell  and i asked the question earlier today  is this something like bidens mark of the beast  because that is really disturbing and not good   oh  if youre going to come into the football game  or the baseball game  or the concert  you need your vaccine passport because were trying to do good job to keep everyone safe  this is what the biden administration is trying to talk these private companies into doing  well lets analyze that  you see  its still the same thing  its still fascism  or communism  whatever you want to call it  but its coming from private companies  so i have term for that  i call it corporate communism  the idea of so called vaccine passport involves way for private companies to be able to verify patrons risk factor while attending certain public events  for example  business would be able to check for confirmation if customer had received covid    vaccination  the process might also provide information if the person had recently tested negative for the virus  the associated press  ap  published an explainer about vaccine passports  ap noted that several companies were developing potential passport product  the travel industry has shown particular interest in the idea after international air travel collapsed during the pandemic  also included in aps explainer was information on how wealthier countries may benefit from vaccine passport implementation  this would potentially leave less fortunate countries behind  on march     cbs news reported that the white house was leaving the work of creating vaccine passports to the private sector  this is going to hit all parts of society  and so naturally  the government is involved  andy slavitt  acting director for the centers for medicare and medicaid services  said during white house covid    briefing monday  but unlike other parts of the world  the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create passport  nor place to hold the data of  of citizens  we view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do  whats important to us  and were leading an interagency process right now to go through these details  are that some important criteria be met with these credentials  in sum  its true that greene referred to vaccine passport as bidens mark of the beast  company navigate sections account                by snopes media group

viral messages claiming    year old doctor hari harini from tamil nadu died after being administered painkiller diclofenac immediately following her vaccination for covid    is misleading  boom found that while doctors do recommend not consuming diclofenac to reduce pain post the covid    vaccine  dr  harini was administered the same  month after her vaccination and not immediately as the message claims   dr  hari harini received the vaccine in february      while her husband administered her diclofenac for some pain that she was undergoing on march     the tamil nadu health ministry stated that the doctor s death was likely due to complications of the diclofenac injection and the covid    vaccine was not linked to it   the doctor who was studying for her md anaesthesia  at madurai medical college was given shot of diclofenac on march    by her husband  dr  p  ashok vignesh  studying for his ms in general surgery in the same college  dr  hari harini s death has led to the emergence of several posts on social media wherein people are sharing advisories about choosing paracetamol for pain relief instead of diclofenac after receiving the covid    vaccine jab  whether covishield or covaxin  boom also received the message on its whatsapp tipline    was dr  hari harini s death related to the covid    vaccine  boom contacted dr  kannan  medical administrator of meenakshi mission hospital  madurai  where dr  hari harini was admitted on march      she was taken to two hospitals before they got her to our hospital  she was unconscious but it was difficult for us to revive her and she was on the ventilator for week    referring to her medical history  dr  kannan said that dr  hari harini had received both her shots of the vaccine by february and after month in march  she developed some pain  for which her husband administered diclofenac   we do not know what the reason for her pain was  but the diclofenac injection could have probably had an anaphylactic reaction   dr  kannan said   when asked if the covid    vaccine had any role to play for the emergence of pain  dr  kannan said that the medical evaluations conducted so far do not suggest that the covid    vaccine had any role to play  he added   her pain arose month after the vaccine and thus  the vaccine has been ruled out    what is diclofenac   diclofenac is non steroidal anti inflammatory drug  nsaid  which is useful for pain relief along with many other uses   boom contacted dr  akshay challani  physician   intensivist  akshjyot clinic  navi mumbai who said that diclofenac should only be administered after doctor s prescription   this anti inflammatory is not available over the counter as it has its own complications and side effects   explained dr  challani  it is used to reduce swelling but also reduce joint stiffness during arthritis  it is available in the form of an oral tablet as well as an injection   relation of diclofenac with covid    according to the tamil nadu health ministry  dr  hari harini suffered an anaphylactic shock after receiving the diclofenac shot  dr  challani emphasised on doing thorough check up before prescribing or administering this drug as it has side effects    after receiving the covid    vaccine  diclofenac for pain relief is not recommended  there are few studies being conducted but there is not conclusive data on the effect of the drug after receiving the vaccine  its effect on covid    is studied along with its family of other nsaid drugs    said dr  challani   the family of nsaids are known to interact with the heart  dr  challani further explained  dr kannan reiterated what dr  challani said   diclofenac after the covid    vaccine is not recommended  i suggest people to use paracetamol instead        study published in plos medicine shows that diclofenac use can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with pre existing conditions such as diabetes  high cholesterol or other high risk factors for cardiovascular problems   for covid     the who conducted review of    studies  wherein apart from one clear study that showed adverse reactions among patients with viral infection and mild covid    who were given diclofenac  in all the other studies  the effect of diclofenac on adverse events among covid    patients was unclear   there has been no clear study to explain the effect of nsaids after taking the covid    vaccine  doctors  however recommend  paracetamol over other painkillers as all of the others normally are known to have side effects,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
source  abdul alim muhammad  damon jones  facebook  instagram     mar       Â      review   on    march       rapper damon jones  who goes by the handle  youngkhanthadon on instagram  posted video on instagram  which was then shared on facebook page called vintage king on    march       receiving more than        views to date  in the video  abdul alim muhammad  member of the nation of islam  which has been designated as an extremist group by the southern poverty law center  claimed that the mrna covid    vaccines are not real vaccines  but operating systems that  over the course of four doses  transform the human body into virus making factory  he also claimed that the mrna vaccines turn people into zombies  however  for the reasons explained below  alims claims about the mrna covid    vaccines are factually inaccurate and misinterpret pages on the moderna and the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  websites  the mrna vaccine is not even vaccine  its an operating system that takes over the machinery of your cells on page explaining their mrna technology platform  the pharmaceutical company moderna compared it to an operating system on computer because it can work with different programs  where each program represents unique mrna sequence that codes for desired protein  moderna and pfizer are the two companies that produce mrna covid    vaccines authorized for emergency use by the u s  food and drug administration  fda   all vaccines train the immune systems of vaccinated people to identify and respond to future pathogens  traditionally  vaccines did this by presenting dead or weakened version of bacteria or virus to persons immune system  for instance  the yellow fever vaccine uses weakened version of the yellow fever virus  while the pertussis vaccine uses an inactivated  dead  form of the bacteria that causes whooping cough  additionally  some vaccines  like protein subunit vaccines  work by presenting only part of the pathogen to person  generally component of the pathogens exterior that generates an immune reaction  like protein subunit vaccines  mrna vaccines work by presenting one part of the pathogen to people  so when they come into contact with the actual pathogen  their immune system can rapidly respond  however  mrna vaccines have some unique characteristics that comprise new vaccine approach  in these vaccines  the mrna acts as recipe to produce specific protein from the pathogen  when the vaccine enters human cells  the cells produce copies of the protein  stimulating an immune response against the protein from the pathogen  in the case of covid     the mrna vaccines carry the code for the spike protein found on the surface of the sars cov   virus  when individuals receive mrna covid    vaccines  their immune systems detect this protein  identify it as an interloper  and learn how to rapidly respond to the actual pathogen in the future  therefore  the claim that mrna vaccines are not even real vaccines is inaccurate  additionally  the claim that they are an operating system is also incorrect  as this is misinterpretation of the moderna page that used computer operating systems as an analogy to explain how their mrna vaccine platform works  the vaccine theyre giving out now causes the body to produce the s protein  the spike protein  so thats why people test positive for hiv    by the time you get your fourth shot your body will be making all four proteins that make up the covid    virus  the moderna and pfizer mrna covid    vaccines code for the spike protein found on the surface of the sars cov   virus  both vaccines require two doses to achieve full efficacy against the disease  in an article for the conversation  physician scientist william petri from the university of virginia explained that the first dose primes the immune system and introduces the body to the germ of interest  this allows the immune system to prepare its defense  the second dose arrives three to four weeks later and is booster that provides the opportunity for the immune system to ramp up the quality and quantity of the antibodies used to fight the virus  wrote petri  the two doses of the mrna covid    vaccines code for the same spike protein  spike proteins are common feature of coronaviruses that help them latch onto and enter cells Â spike proteins are typical feature of coronaviruses and its what gives this group of viruses their name  when seen in an electron microscope  the spikes look like crown or corona  when speaking of the spike protein  alim claimed that individuals who produced the spike protein also test positive for the human immunodeficiency virus  hiv   its unclear what evidence this claim is based on  but it may have its roots in an australian covid    vaccine candidate that caused some clinical trial participants to give false positives in hiv tests  that vaccine used molecular clamp technology  where the clamp holds the protein of interest  in this case the spike protein  in conformation that generates the greatest immune reaction  for the australian vaccine candidate  part of the clamp was generated using segments from an hiv protein called gp   and some of the trial participants generated partial antibody response to gp    this led these trial participants to test positive in hiv screening tests  even though they didnt have an hiv infection  however  the mrna covid    vaccines authorized for use by the fda dont use the molecular clamp technology or carry segments of hiv proteins  therefore  the claim that they would cause recipients to test positive for hiv is factually inaccurate  additional inaccurate claims were made in the video about the moderna and pfizer mrna covid    vaccines  including that there are four doses  with each coding for different sars cov   protein  s  m  n and p  the video also alleged that after the fourth shot your body will be making all four proteins that make up the covid    virus  the sars cov   virus codes for    proteins  four structural proteins  s  m  n and e  and    non structural and accessory proteins that the virus uses to replicate and hide from the human immune system  as such  the claim has three factual inaccuracies  first  there is no p protein  second  the available mrna vaccines arent delivered in four doses  but two  and  third  four proteins dont make up the covid    virus  which has    proteins  and therefore the mrna vaccines wont cause recipients to start making sars cov    why the cdc has  sic  an emergency program for the coming zombie preparedness     where are you going to get all these zombies from  its called the mrna vaccine  there is page on zombie preparedness on the website of the united states centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   the page explains that the zombie preparedness guide began as tongue in cheek campaign to engage new audiences with preparedness messages  by explaining how people can prepare for fictional zombie apocalypse  the cdc provided advice for readers about how to prepare for real emergencies  such as hurricanes  earthquakes  and floods  one of the cdcs recommendations was to prepare an emergency kit with few essentials  including gallon of water per person per day and non perishable foods  the cdc maintains the zombie preparedness page due to the success of the campaign  suggesting that the cdc keeps the zombie preparedness page because it expects future zombie apocalypse is misinterpretation of the cdcs webpage  additionally  the mrna covid    vaccines wont transform people into zombies  while the mrna covid    vaccines represent new approach to making vaccines  they function like all other vaccines that train peoples immune systems to recognize and react to future pathogens  additionally  the mrna vaccines carry recipe for producing only one protein  the sars cov   spike protein  and both doses of the vaccine carry the same recipe  the claims made in the video by alim about the mrna vaccines are factually inaccurate and misinform viewers about how these vaccines work    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
a second wave of covid    is being planned and the vaccines will kill people  both claims are false  this article was published before the mhra announced possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and very rare type ofÂ bloodÂ clot  which can be fatal  itÂ was correct at the time of writing  our latest fact checks about covid    and the pandemicÂ can be found here  video on instagram that has been viewed more than        times claims that second wave of covid    has been planned  and covid    vaccines are going to be fatal  both claims are false  conspiracy theories about the planning of covid    have been shared widely on social media before  these include claims that full fact has already debunked  including that event      pandemic response planning exercise  was rehearsal for the coronavirus pandemic  that the virus was man made and that bill gates owns the vaccine for or patent of covid     there is no evidence that the creation or spread of covid    has at any point been orchestrated by political  commercial or other organisations institutions  in any case  second wave of covid    cases has already happened  at least in the uk  and political leaders have begun warning of third wave rise in cases Â  we have also repeatedly debunked claims that covid    vaccines are deadly  analysis by the medicines healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  did not suggest that fatalities of early recipients were caused by the vaccine  it also found the none of the serious adverse reactions reported appear to have been caused by the vaccine Â  more recent data on the yellow card scheme  the uk system for collecting and monitoring information on safety concerns such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents involving medicines and medical devices  shows that despite many millions of vaccine doses administered no new safety concerns have been reported  the mhra also notes that of the medical conditions reported in temporal association with vaccination  the available evidence does not currently suggest that the vaccine caused the event  update    august      line was added at the beginning of this article to reflect new information about vaccine safety  which appeared after it was published  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because there is no evidence either that covid    was planned or that its vaccines are deadly,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
the mrna covid    vaccines are experimental  the mrna vaccines have been tested for safety and effectiveness like any other vaccine  while this is the first time mrna vaccines have become available to the public  they have been researched for many years  the mrna covid    vaccines have not been tested on animals  false  both the pfizer and moderna vaccines have been tested on animals  the vaccines havent been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans  the vaccines have been tested on humans since mid       if vaccines produce side effects  these are usually detectable in the short term  the effects of the vaccines are not reversible  it is unclear how long the protection given by covid    vaccines lasts against the disease  most side effects observed are mild and pass within few days  the vaccines wont stop me getting covid     they most likely will  all the vaccines available are highly effective at preventing covid    development  the vaccines wont stop me spreading covid     emerging research shows covid    vaccination does lead to lower levels of transmission  the vaccines wont allow me to stop wearing mask  true  people who have been vaccinated still have to follow rules on mask wearing  the vaccines contain genetically modified organisms  true  some of them  such as the astrazeneca vaccine  do contain gmos  the astrazeneca and johnson   johnson vaccines contain aborted human and monkey cells  partly false  both vaccines use cell lines derived from aborted foetal cells but those cells do not make it into the final vaccine  neither contain or use monkey cells  doctors have concerns about the mrna vaccines long term effect on fertility  false  the nhs says there s no evidence the vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women  but more evidence is needed before pregnant women can be routinely offered the vaccine  there is no evidence the vaccines affect fertility  there is risk of autoimmune disease  strokes  seizures  convulsions and other side effects from the vaccines  the vaccines cause mild  transient side effects such as arm pain or fatigue for most people  there isnt much evidence linking the vaccines directly to more severe side effects  possible reported side effects are continually monitored to detect such links  the vaccines have caused deaths and injuries  the mhra has determined possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and rare blood clot which has caused    deaths in the uk to    june       vaccine manufacturers are not liable for injuries or deaths caused by the vaccines  true  mostly  in the uk  covid    vaccine manufacturers are protected from much  but not all  civil liability that arises as result of the vaccines  doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take the vaccine  far more doctors and scientists are recommending people to take the vaccine than to not take it  covid    vaccine q sheet has been circulating on social media  it presents checklist of claims about the vaccine  alongside yes or no answers  some of the claims are inaccurate and suggest the mrna vaccines may be dangerous  the covid    vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as any vaccine would be  while side effects are common  these are overwhelmingly minor and pass within few days Â Â  while these are the first mrna vaccines to be rolled out to the general public  the technology behind mrna vaccines has been developed over number of years Â Â  in the uk  two of the three approved covid    vaccines   the pfizer vaccine and the moderna vaccine   use mrna technology Â  both mrna covid    vaccines have passed the same safety tests and procedures any other vaccine would  many vaccines work by introducing weakened or inactive virus or bacteria into the body which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies in response  these antibodies then protect the body if it comes into contact with the real thing  covid    mrna vaccines go one step back in the process  once inside the body  the mrna works to build the spike proteins on the surface of the covid    virus  the body then responds by producing antibodies which attack those proteins this means that if it is later infected  the body will be able to generate faster and more effective immune response to the virus  this is untrue  the moderna  pfizer and astrazeneca vaccines have all been tested on animals  the associated press reports this confusion may have arisen because moderna and pfizer were given permission to test their vaccines on human trial participants concurrently with animal tests  ordinarily animal tests are done before human trials Â  have they been subject to medium or long term safety testing on humans  no this depends on how you define medium or long term  the vaccines have been trialled on humans since mid       so we do have over six months of safety data for each vaccine  pfizer and moderna have said they will continue monitoring their trialists for safety  its unclear whats meant by reversible Â  all the vaccines are intended to protect people against covid     it is unclear how long that protection will last  and so in that sense the effects of the vaccines may wear off over time  the vaccines can cause side effects but the vast majority of these  such as pain around the injection site  fatigue or nausea  are mild and pass within few days Â  the evidence suggesting vaccinations can cause more serious side effects resulting in permanent damage is far more limited  for example in the pfizer trial  the proportion of people who experienced serious adverse event after vaccination with the pfizer vaccine was      and among the group of people who received the placebo it was       vaccine safety is continually monitored  people in the uk who suspect they have experienced side effect due to vaccine are encouraged to report this to the yellow card scheme  these reports are then investigated to determine whether there is any link to the vaccines  all the vaccines available significantly reduce the risk of developing covid     looking specifically at the mrna vaccines  on clinical trials  participants who had received the moderna vaccine were     less likely to contract covid    than participants who received the placebo  and none developed severe covid  recipients of the pfizer vaccine were     less likely to contract covid    than participants who received the placebo  in real world data from israel  recipients of the pfizer vaccine were     less likely to develop symptomatic covid    and     less likely to contract severe covid  emerging evidence suggests the vaccines also stop the spread of the sars cov   virus which causes covid     as well as stopping those infections turning into symptomatic illnesses  for example  recent scottish study  which hasnt been peer reviewed yet  found that the rate of infection among people who live with healthcare workers was at least     lower when the worker had been vaccinated Â  public health scotland  phs  said  since household members of healthcare workers can also be infected via other people  not just via the healthcare worker they live with   this     relative risk reduction is an underestimate of the true effect of vaccination on transmission  but dr diane stockton  phs lead for covid    vaccination surveillance programme  also said   despite this good news  it is important to remember that infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings remain of paramount importance  as do the mitigations to prevent spread in our daily lives Â  the risk of transmission did not go down to zero after the healthcare worker was vaccinated  current uk government guidelines still require vaccinated people to follow the same rules as unvaccinated people when it comes to wearing mask  some of the vaccines do contain gmos  for example  the astrazeneca vaccine uses modified version of virus  which carries the genetic instructions for producing the coronavirus spike protein into human cells  without replicating itself and infecting the body Â Â  some vaccines use virus as the active ingredient  as mentioned  for example  the astrazeneca covid    vaccine uses virus  viruses need cells to replicate  so vaccine manufacturers use cells to manufacture enough of the virus for their vaccines  for example  the influenza vaccine is often made using chicken eggs  for the astrazeneca covid    vaccine  the virus is replicated using modified copies of cells taken from an aborted foetus in the     s  this cell line is called hek     and weve written about it before Â  the johnson   johnson vaccine uses different virus grown in cells taken from an aborted foetus in       so both vaccines are produced using copies of copies of these cells  rather than the original foetal cells themselves  and while the cells are used to grow the virus  they are filtered out of the vaccine  meaning neither vaccine contain s  aborted human cells  its unclear where the reference to monkey cells comes from  but it may be misinterpretation of the fact that the virus used in the astrazeneca vaccine is an altered version of virus that typically infects chimpanzees  this doesnt mean it comes from chimpanzees  there is no evidence that mrna vaccines would impact fertility  but until more research is done to confirm they are safe for pregnant women  the nhs is currently recommending most pregnant women do not receive any covid    vaccine  it says pregnant women with pre existing conditions who might be at risk of developing severe complications should they contract the illness  and women who are at high risk of contracting the disease due to where they work  may still be able to get the vaccination  the reason why there has been concern is because the sars cov   spike protein bears slight resemblance to proteins in the placenta  the theory being that if the vaccine leads to the body producing antibodies which attack the virus  those antibodies might also attack the placenta  but as weve said the resemblance is only slight and realistically the body is not likely to confuse the two Â  if this was the case  then covid    infection itself would also lead to fertility problems  and this had not been observed  weve written about this before Â  as mentioned  many people may experience side effects with covid    vaccines but these are overwhelmingly mild and pass within few days Â  vaccine safety is continually monitored  people in the uk who suspect they have experienced side effect due to vaccine are encouraged to report this to the yellow card scheme  as weve said  these are then investigated to determine whether the vaccine was the cause or not  in the us there is similar system for reporting suspected side effects called vaers Â  weve written more about claims linking vaccinations and specific side effects  when this article was originally published  no deaths had been directly attributed to covid    vaccinations  as mentioned  in the uk  deaths and side effects can be reported to the yellow card scheme for investigation  since then  and as of    june       there have been    deaths in the uk from certain extremely rare type of blood clot  occurring alongside low level of platelets  component of the blood   following vaccination with the astrazeneca vaccine  the mhra has concluded there is possible link between the two Â  to    june            million people in the uk have received dose of the astrazeneca vaccine  meaning that if all    deaths were caused by the vaccine  the risk of death could be          or   in          by contrast  covid    itself is estimated to kill around        of people who are infected in countries with similar age profiles and healthcare to the uk Â  in the uk the vaccines have gone through all the normal safety checks and received temporary authorisation to be rolled out  but they have not been fully licensed  this means that vaccine manufacturers are free from some types of liability  however manufacturers arent fully protected  for example  the uk government says that manufacturers will still be liable if their vaccines do not meet safety standards or are defective  some doctors and scientists are recommending people not to take covid    vaccines Â  far more doctors  health professionals and public health bodies are recommending the vaccine and they have been found to be safe and effective  update    june      this article was updated following the mhra s statement that there may be link between rare type of blood clot and the astrazeneca vaccine  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as partly false                 because some of the claims  especially around the effectiveness  composition and testing of covid    vaccines are incorrect,[0. 0. 1. 0.

the astrazeneca vaccine in the uk causes blood clots  the astrazeneca covid    vaccine is not associated with an increased overall risk of blood clotting disorders  there have been small number of cases of rare type of blood clot following vaccination  it is not clear whether this is linked to the vaccine or not  and this is being closely monitored by regulatory bodies  while this article was correct at the time it was first published  the evidence regarding possible association between blood clots and the astrazeneca vaccine has moved on  and the guidance from the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency and european medicines agency has been updated Â  our piece on the evidence and guidance around the astrazeneca vaccine can be found here Â  this article has been archived as result  you can find our latest fact checks on covid    here  video of sky news segment has been shared on social media by group called mysteries  truths  and conspiracies  with the caption  uk jabs causing blood clots  but denied as you would expect  this caption is false  Â as of mid march  when the post was published  there was not sufficient evidence to say that the astrazeneca vaccine has caused blood clots  it is not clear if the post is suggesting that sky news is denying its claim about the blood clots  or that its reporting on blood clots is being denied by others  both are incorrect  Â the sky news video discusses some cases of people who have had blood clots around the time of vaccination  and the precautionary action taken by some european  and some non european  countries Â  it clearly says that these occurrences are not happening more frequently in vaccinated people than they would normally in the general unvaccinated population Â  in fact  during the video  science correspondent thomas moore  says   theres no increased rate of blood clots following vaccination  experts say the european reaction has been disproportionate  Â  he ends the report saying  theres nothing to suggest causal link between clots and the vaccine  so there seems no reason to be worried about either vaccine being used in the uk roll out  Â  we have written about this topic before Â  due to reports of people developing blood clots close to the time of vaccination  in march  some countries temporarily suspended their vaccination programmes as precautionary measure Â  up until the   th march     the week of the suspensions   cases of thromboembolic events  formation of blood clot in blood vessel  had been reported in the five million people who had received the astrazeneca vaccine in the european economic area  all eu member states  plus iceland  liechtenstein and norway   the normal occurrence of blood clots in the general population  unvaccinated  is   in       and likely higher in older age groups  and so as described by the european medicines agency  ema   this number was no higher than we might normally expect Â  it said  the number of thromboembolic events overall in vaccinated people seems not to be higher than that seen in the general population  rough estimate  calculated by professor david spiegelhalter  chair of the winton centre for risk and evidence communication at cambridge university  demonstrated that wed expect roughly about     people week to have issues with blood clots  which is far more than the    seen over month or so following the astrazeneca vaccine  the ema has since reviewed the data and issued information for patients  saying the astrazeneca vaccine is not associated with an increased overall risk of blood

against    diseases free of cost  the logical indian fact check team found that the infographic is misleading   the    preventable vaccines that congress is talking about come under the national

hepatitis b and haemophilus influenza type b   measles vaccine  vitamin  dpt vaccine  which protects against diphtheria  pertussis  whooping cough   and tetanus   tetanus vaccine  the website of

helped to immunize children against nine diseases  in       the congress led upa government was in the centre  vaccines provided under uip during bjp led nda government  according to the pdf  faqs on immunization       present on the website nhm gov in  we found the government now provides vaccines against    viruses  ipv         rotavirus vaccine        pneumococcal conjugate vaccine        and measles rubella        are the latest vaccines that were introduced under the uip scheme during the regime of the bjp led nda government  in the pdf  faqs on immunization        it is clearly mentioned that  under india s universal immunization programme    different vaccines are provided to beneficiaries free of cost  through the government health system   the logical indian spoke to an

largest private hospital players who said   private hospitals do not provide vaccines for free  they never have  however  government hospitals do   hence  it is clear that in both the upa and nda

mislead about covid    vaccines  the logical indian found out press release by the ministry of health  and family welfare published on february           according to the press release  all vaccines provided to beneficiaries at the government health facilities will be entirely free of cost  at the same time  private facilities cannot charge the beneficiary sum above rs      per person per dose  rs       for vaccines and rs       as operational charges   hence  the coronavirus vaccines are free of cost in government hospitals  similar claim was made by west bengal chief minister mamata

party  billy te kahika  and the party he was briefly allied with  advance new zealand Â  the claims made in the video posted to facebook  however  are combination of missing context and misleading according to experts Â  university of queensland immunologist dr larisa labzin told afp in an interview that covid    vaccines have been developed in record breaking time governments invested lot of money to help them develop through the trial phases  lot of governments really invested lot of money to ramp up production so there were no gaps in between phases  of the vaccine trials   they said Â  while the pre clinical trials were running  they were already starting to set up for the phase one  two and three clinical trials  so what that says is  they were thinking lets assume these trials work  what do we need to do to not waste time  dr labzin said Â  dr helen petoussis harris  vaccinologist from the university of auckland told afp in march    email the claim is misleading because it gives the impression there was lack of diligence in creating the covid    vaccines Â  covid    vaccines have been developed with unprecedented speed thanks to substantial funding and collaboration  all steps and processes associated with vaccine development and testing have been followed and assessed closely by regulatory agencies all over the world  she said  trials for the pfizer and astrazeneca covid    mrna vaccinations are ongoing  with the pfizer trials set to collect efficacy and safety data in participants for an additional two years  according to this release on their website Â  however  long term safety and efficacy trials normally continue  sometimes for decades  after vaccines haveÂ been rolled out  said dr petoussis harris Â  according to dr labzin  ongoing monitoring of trial participants helpÂ scientists gather more data on the vaccine s efficacy  indications of long term effects and how long the vaccine is protective for Â  basically its just scientists continuing to monitor whether the vaccine is safe  effective and how it works with rarer conditions that might not have come up in clinical trials Â  the roll out of the vaccine is an important part of understanding how effective the vaccine is in real world setting including testing countries public health measures and monitoring the virus spread among age groups  dr labzin explained Â  all those types of real world variables that will influence how sick people will get  which you have to take into account when people get vaccine  but are really difficult to test during smaller clinical trial  she said  dr petousis harris pointed out mrna vaccines arent actually new  the technology has been around for many years and there are numerous studies in humans Â  according to this articleÂ from the harvard medical school  mrna vaccines were first thought up about    years ago Â  mrna vaccines have been studied for use against influenza  zika virus  rabies and cytomegalovirus  states theÂ us centre for disease control  as soon as the necessary information about the virus that causes covid    was available  scientists began designing the mrna instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mrna vaccine  this cdc web page explains  dr labzin also told afp that if we were to stop the roll out of every new medicine or vaccine based on the fact that its new  then wed still have lot of disease Â  and in terms of it being experimental  its no longer just experimental because its been tested and shown to be safe in clinical trials and thats exactly why we do clinical trials  she said Â  the coronavirus vaccines were not tested for their ability to prevent infection or spread of sars cov   because researchers wanted to work out first and foremost if they would stop people experiencing the disease known as covid     according to dr labzin Â  if coronavirus infected us  replicated and transmitted on  but we didnt get sick from it to be honest we wouldnt really care  the problem is that it makes us really sick  so the first thing the vaccine has to do is to stop us getting really sick  so thats what they were measuring it in clinical trials  dr labzin said Â  its also more effective to test vaccine s ability to prevent transmission after its been deployed  because it can be measured in real world populations after the vaccine is being used in those populations  dr petousis harris told afp Â  the emerging data so far indicates that the vaccines are able to prevent both infection and spread  in line with pre clinical data  dr petoussis harris said  however  the paper showing the oxford astrazeneca vaccine reduces transmission has not been peer reviewed leaving the test results as still preliminary findings

social media video falsely likens covid    mrna vaccines to delayed killswitch  claiming they will cause the immune system to attack persons cells and organs should they encounter the coronavirus  an instagram video  shared on march   by an australian account  features osteopath carrie madej  who claims that in the past    years researchers experimented with mrna vaccines on animals and had terrible results  she claims initially the animals elicited robust immune response but when challenged by the virus or bacteria they got sicker or died  she says the immune response is called cytokine storm  adding that people who received mrna covid    vaccines could expect similar response  she also claims researchers skipped animal trials with  the covid    mrna  vaccines because they dont want anyone to know that  at the time of writing  the video had been viewed more than        times and has attracted more than     likes  another post  which included the same video  had attracted more than        views and more than     likes  madej has previously pushed debunked claims that mrna vaccines can alter the human genome  despite the videos claims  experts say there is no evidence that suggests covid    mrna vaccines will cause cytokine storm response in humans when they encounter the virus post inoculation  the video also falsely claims that drug companies skipped animal studies because of earlier trials involving mrna vaccines that led to test subjects becoming seriously ill or dying  two covid    vaccines based on messenger rna  or mrna  platforms have been approved for emergency use in the us  these vaccines  from pfizer biontech and moderna  cause the body to produce protein that triggers an immune response  producing antibodies that can prevent sars cov   infection  in the video  carrie madej  an osteopathic physician  makes number of claims about the safety of mrna vaccines  including that they will cause delayed severe immune response called cytokine storm when recipients later encounter the coronavirus  markus hofer  senior lecturer at the university of sydney researching cytokines and immune responses in the central nervous system  said cytokine storm was essentially an overshooting of the immune response that could lead to organ failure  he told aap factcheck that cytokines were molecular messengers that help control how the immune system responds to pathogens  their production was normally kept under tight control  but cytokine storm could occur when the body produced too many in response to situation like an infection  however  in relation to the videos claims  bali pulendran  professor of microbiology and immunology from stanford university  said he was not aware of any reports of cytokine storms being associated with covid    mrna vaccines  noting that they had been tested in tens of thousands of people in vaccine efficacy trials  prof pulendra added that the use of modified mrna was relatively recent development in vaccine treatments  normally  the mrna can be recognised by some receptors in the immune system and this can give rise to cytokine production and activation of the immune system  he told aap factcheck in an interview  but what these companies have done is chemically modify the mrna so that it is unable to stimulate these  immune  receptors  global team infection experts at meedans digital health lab wrote in january article that there is no evidence to suggest that mrna covid    vaccines or non mrna covid    vaccines would result in cytokine storms  in the video  madej refers to unspecified mrna animal studies in the past    years which showed vaccinated animals died when later challenged with virus  she also claimed these negative results were the reason why researchers skipped the animal trials for  the mrna covid    vaccines        study involving possible vaccines for the sars coronavirus did highlight that some mice became ill after vaccination when challenged with the live virus  however  none were based on mrna technology and the studys lead author told reuters in february that the covid    inoculations were based on very different vaccine platforms  none of the mice died from the virus  similarly       study highlighted an increased risk of lung inflammation in mice treated with an inactivated vaccine for the mers coronavirus  again  the study did not relate to mrna based vaccines  contrary to claim in the video  pfizers mrna vaccine was tested on both mice and rhesus macaque monkeys  inducing strong antigen specific immune responses with no evidence of disease enhancement  modernas candidate was also tested on rhesus macaques  leading to the conclusion that it induced robust sars cov   neutralising activity  rapid protection in the upper and lower airways  and no pathologic changes in the lung  similar claims regarding cytokine reactions and covid    mrna vaccines have been debunked by snopes and reuters  while aap factcheck has previously addressed other misinformation relating to mrna vaccines here and here  there is no evidence to support the claim that covid    mrna vaccines will induce cytokine storm  according to experts  the video also falsely claims that pfizer and moderna skipped animal trials for their vaccines  in fact  successful animal and human trials were completed for the inoculations  false  content that has no

to the ecological research and development group  nonprofit organization whose primary focus is the conservation of horseshoe crab species  lal tests are used at all stages in the production of medicine and biological products to ensure that endotoxins are not present Â  this compound coagulates or clumps up in the presence of small amounts of bacterial toxins and is used to test for sterility of medical equipment and virtually all injectable drugs  that way  when you get vaccine you know it hasnt been contaminated by any bacteria  wrote the florida fish and wildlife conservation

individual crabs were collected by the biomedical industry to support the production of lal  reported the atlantic states marine fisheries commission  research has shown though that the bleeding of crabs is ecologically unsustainable for all four species of horseshoe crabs  both for the crab themselves and the shorebirds that feed on their eggs  studies have also shown that even though crabs are released back into the wild after they have been bled  up to     of crabs harvested may die  and that doesnt account for further trauma the animal may experience once its returned to the ocean  to combat this  researchers have biotechnologically engineered substance known as recombinant factor c  rfc  that could be used as an alternative to lal tests in some products  like testing of water and other materials used in the manufacturing process  potentially reducing the need to bleed horseshoe crabs by      over the course of six year study ending in       rfc was shown to be equally as reliable as lal tests and suitable for routine bacterial endotoxin  in may       the usp expressed support for the introduction of rfc to the u s  market as synthetic alternative  noting that it

the claims made by the doctors were contrary to the the guidelines issued by the health ministry Â  some doctors  who are known for their anti vaccination viewpoints  have shared an advisory stating that unmarried women  children  people with breathing issues  people who smoke or drink alcohol  people with neurological issues  and those who have diabetes should not take the covid    vaccine  however  we found that some of the claims were misleading  the ministry of health and family welfare  mohfw  and vaccine manufacturers have already issued guidelines on who should and should not take the vaccine  the guidelines dont mention the points that the viral claim carried  claim the claim was shared in the form of an advisory which was titled  who should not the vaccine   the advisory went on to list six categories of people who should not take the vaccine  those are  the advisory was signed off by few doctors  some of whom   dr tarun kothari  dr biswaroop roy choudhary   have been known to spread medical misinformation and conspiracy theories  what we found out dr kothari and dr choudhary have questioned the existence of novel coronavirus and have dismissed it as the flu and continue to do so despite being fact checked several times  some of their claims have been debunked by fit previously  claim    unmarried women may become infertile the safety and efficacy data for the vaccines approved in india  covaxin and covishield   have been studied and infertility was not one of the side effects mentioned  the fact sheets released by serum institute of india and bharat biotech also do not mention that unmarried women should avoid the vaccine  similar claim was also made about the vaccine produced by pfizer which was debunked by fit  claim    children should not take it as it can cause diseases in the future until now  the mohfw has only permitted vaccines to be administered to people over the age of     the age cap comes from the fact that people under the age of    were not part of the trials conducted to test the safety ad efficacy of the vaccines  moreover  studies and tests are being conducted to make an intranasal vaccine for easy administration  aiims director dr randeep guleria said in recent interview  vaccines for children may come later bharat biotech is trying to get approved nasal vaccine  such vaccine will be very easy to be given to children as it is spray and not jab and hence compliance is more  claim    anybody who has ever suffered from respiratory disorders neither the mohfw nor the manufacturers have specifically mentioned these or diseases people with respiratory disorders to not take the vaccine  we also found report published on the british lung foundations website that said that people with lungs disorder can take the vaccine  however  the guidelines issued by the mohfw have mentioned that anyone who is acutely ill or hospitalised with any disease should not take the vaccine  it is also advisable to consult ones regular physician in case of any severe comorbidities  claim    those who smoke or consume alcohol  as it can cause cancer like the previous claims  this contraindication has not been mentioned in the guidelines released by the government and manufacturers  on the contrary  smokers are being given the first preference in the united states of america as they are more at risk from the novel coronavirus  claim    people with neurological issues should not take the vaccine the oxford astrazeneca vaccine had to stop its clinical trial after patient displayed neurological symptoms during the study  it was later reported that the patient was supposedly suffering from rare but serious spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis  it is also advised that people should consult with their regular physician before taking the vaccine if they are seriously ill  claim    diabetics should not take the vaccine as per the guidelines released by the ministry of health  people  between the ages of        who have been suffering from diabetes for more than    years or have complications induced by diabetes and have problem of hypertension as well will also be allowed to take the vaccine along with people over the age of     the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  has said that people with type   and type   diabetes have an increased risk for severe illness from covid     therefore  it is important that diabetics take the vaccine soon to avoid getting the virus  the government has clearly stated that certain group of people   people who are pregnant lactating  people with history of anaphylactic or allergic reactions  people with an allergy to injectable therapies  pharma products   should not take the vaccine  additionally  those exhibiting symptoms of sars cov   should also wait for     weeks before taking the vaccine  the knowledge about the disease and its vaccine is rapidly developing  but the claims made in the advisory are

video being shared on social media has used data from us vaccine reporting system in misleading attempt to link covid    vaccines to serious adverse health events including death  the clip  posted to facebook on march   by an australian user  features female speaker trawling through the us vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  database for records purportedly relating to covid    vaccinations  the speaker begins with claim that less than one per cent of vaccine injuries and deaths get reported before scrolling through list claimed to show people who have died within seven days of the inoculations  do you see why i say its not safe  unfortunately these people did not survive the vaccine  the woman can be heard saying  the video ends with screenshot of the records sorted and caption that claims healthy one year old died from seizure after having the covid    vaccine  at the time of writing  the post had been shared more than     times and viewed more than        times  similar posts have used entries in the reporting system to try to link covid    vaccines to other negative health effects  the video shows records contained in the vaers database  however this information is not proof of causal link between reported events and vaccinations  the records are unverified and can be supplied by anyone  leaving open the possibility that some reports may be intentionally misleading  one expert says  to date  us health authorities have no confirmed reports of any deaths linked to covid    vaccines  as of march     us officials had administered more than     million covid    vaccine doses  with over    million people fully vaccinated with one of the three treatments  pfizer biontech  moderna and janssen  approved by the food and drugs administration  fda  for emergency use  the vaccine adverse event reporting system was established in      to monitor possible adverse events related to vaccinations  anyone can lodge an incident report  including the general public  however  as noted in centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  factsheet  the system does not show that vaccines caused the reported events  rather it helps authorities determine where further investigation may be needed  in guide to interpreting the data  the vaers website says  the report of an adverse event to vaers is not documentation that vaccine caused the event  it also noted that vaers reports may contain information that is incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental  or unverifiable  in large part  reports to vaers are voluntary  which means they are subject to biases  this creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically  data from vaers reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind  it reads  dr al ozonoff  the associate director of the precision vaccine program at boston childrens hospital and an associate professor at harvard medical school  said while vaers is useful due to its accessibility  he cautioned about drawing conclusions based on the data  you can imagine its an open website so somebody can come in and theres no way to verify their contact information  dr ozonoff told aap factcheck in an interview  there is some reliance on the good faith of the participants  and in principle  somebody could submit erroneous or even intentionally misleading information  there may be some follow up from cdc in certain cases but typically its not always possible to verify the information thats provided in the report  spokeswoman for the cdc told aap factcheck in an email that anyone can report to vaers  however  healthcare providers are required to report all deaths that occur following covid    vaccination  there had been       deaths reported to vaers by march   after the administration of more than    million covid    vaccine doses  according to the cdc  it said experts reviewed each death report by assessing all available clinical information including death certificates  autopsies and medical records  the cdc spokeswoman said the organisation has not received any confirmation of covid    vaccine related death       scientific review of vaers found that interpreting data from the system alone or out of context can lead to erroneous conclusions about cause and effect as well as the risk of adverse events occurring following vaccination  another study assessing claims of deaths from vaccinations before the covid    pandemic highlighted vaers data as skewed  stating that it is voluntary system which accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging its clinical significance or whether it was caused by vaccination  vaers is signal detection and hypothesis generating passive surveillance system and therefore any broad claim of cause and effect with respect to deaths following vaccination based on vaers reports should not be interpreted as proof of causality  the study said  it added that verified examples of deaths from any vaccinations were extraordinarily rare  pointing to      study which showed the us death rate one or two months after vaccinations were lower than among the general population  the video also misrepresents the nature of some of the individual reports included in the pictured database  in the case of the one year old boy  claimed in the video to have died after getting the inoculation  the related vaers record shows he did not receive any covid    vaccine shots  id           cdc guidelines state children under the age of    should not receive the covid    vaccine  another sample entry is listed as dying age      after covid    vaccination however the vaers entry notes the individual was killed by self inflicted gunshot wound  id           third example was recorded as dying    days after receiving covid    treatment  not within seven days as claimed in the video  id           similar false and deceptive claims that vaers data shows the vaccinations have caused widespread deaths have been fact checked here  here and here  aap factcheck previously examined potentially misleading posts using vaers data to link covid    vaccines to purported miscarriages  the video falsely claims the vaers database shows records of people in the us who did not survive covid    vaccinations  in fact  the cdc says there are no confirmed cases of people dying as result of the inoculations

effective treatment methods for covid     inhaling steam several times day  taking ivermectin tablets  and following the zelenko protocol  which entailsÂ taking combination of drugs daily for week  however  none of these methods has been scientifically proven to treat covid     according to medical experts Â  afp fact check has previously debunked steam inhalation as treatment for covid    here

the fdaÂ warned against the use of the drug after receiving reports of patients who needed medical helpÂ or were hospitalised after self medicating with ivermectin  the fda has not reviewed data to support use of ivermectin in covid    patients to treat or to prevent covid     however  some initial research is underway  taking drug for unapproved use can be very dangerous  this is true of ivermectin  too  reads the fdas statement  the third suggested treatment is cocktail of hydroxychloroquine  zinc  and azithromycin  an antibiotic   takenÂ for seven days  known as theÂ zelenko protocol  itÂ emerged last year when new york doctor vladimir zelenko claimed to have used this method to successfully treat     covid    patients  however  zelenko ended up being investigated by

afp fact check that pcr testing is the most accurate and reliable covid    test  pcr is the gold standard test for covid    globally and is the best for which others are compared to Â amoth said during phone interview  dr hanan balkhy  professor of paediatrics and infectious diseases  said in an interview with whos vismita gupta smith that pcr testing is the most accurate covid    test  the doctors also claimedÂ that both the pfizer biontech and moderna covid    vaccines are not real vaccines  this claim is false  both rely on technology known as messenger rna  mrna  to activate the immune system against the virus  each vaccine uses synthetic genetic material that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines  even with the new technological developments  both are considered vaccines  the pfizer website and fact sheet refer to the covid    vaccine as the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine on multiple pages  see here Â

injection of vaccines into muscles  when we started injecting the antigen beyond the epithelial layer into the muscles  we breached the natural function of the immune systems Â the document says  this claim has no merit  according to shabir madhi  south african professor of vaccinology  for some of the vaccine  eg mrna  injection into the muscle is required to get the cells to produce the spike protein which is then presented to the immune system  madhi told afp fact check  vaccines are administered using different routes  but injecting into the muscle tissue is most common  according to madhi  most vaccines are given through the intramuscular route  he said  medical experts have explained the benefits of injecting vaccines into the muscles  see here and here   the press statement falsely claims that covid    vaccines are part of plan by american billionaire philanthropist bill gates to depopulate the world  the theory stems from misinterpretation of an excerpt from

population  the world today has     billion people  thats headed up to about nine billion  now  if we do really great job on new vaccines  health care  reproductive health services  we could lower that by  perhaps    or    percent  but there  we see an increase of about     Â gates said  the philanthropist was referring to cutting global population growth by    or    percent to curb carbon

in march       just days after the u s  food and drug administration approved the use of single dose immunization developed by johnson   johnson to curb the covid    outbreak  catholic leaders and evangelicals cautioned followers against accepting the new vaccine because of its alleged ingredients  according to march   statement by leaders of the u s  conference of catholic bishops  for example  the j j vaccine was developed  tested and is produced with abortion derived cell lines  raising ethical concerns for church followers who do not believe in or want to support abortions  another advisory by the archdiocese of new orleans called the immunization morally compromised  the underlying claim  however  was misrepresentation of facts  the vaccine formula does not contain aborted fetal tissue  rather  virologists created j js vaccine  and many other immunizations to fight viral outbreaks  in part by growing modified virus in cells originally derived from embryonic tissue from an abortion performed decades ago  however  that human cell line is physically and chemically separate from ingredients that end up in the final vaccine product  there are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process  dr  michael head  of the university of southampton  told bbc  we explain more about the vaccine production process and final product  sourcing scientific journals and infectious disease experts  below  all covid    vaccines  no matter the sponsor  pfizer  moderna  j j  etc    attempt to train peoples immune systems into producing antibodies that can fight the sars cov   virus if necessary  how the different vaccines achieve that goal  however  varies  for example  j js competitors  pfizer biontech and moderna  use mrna technology  in j js case  the vaccine takes the form of whats called viral vector to attack one specific part of sars cov    similarly  the astrazeneca covid    immunization  which the fda has not approved  as of this writing  uses the same type of technology  dr  amesh adalja  an infectious disease scholar at johns hopkins who works on pandemic policy  told snopes  once person gets the shot  their cells receive the directions from the vector  telling them how to create copies of the spike protein  the medical institution explains of the j j formula on its website  as the spike proteins accumulate in the body  the immune system is alerted to their presence and creates antibodies and an immune reaction to fight them  in j js own words  according to an email from spokesperson for the company to snopes  our covid    vaccine is made using harmless cold like virus into which we insert piece of the coronavirus spike protein  it teaches the immune system to recognize the covid virus and protect against infection  our vaccine contains no fetal tissue whatsoever  it is true  however  that in order to create the materials of the genetically modified vector  otherwise known as the adenovirus  scientists in labs used the descendent of single cell from an aborted fetus that is decades old  like we reported in late       while investigating the same question for astrazeneca vaccine   in order to engineer these type of immunizations mass production  the lines of human embryotic cells serve as miniature factories where the adenoviruses multiply quickly  as explained by science magazine  the adenovirus eventually grow and multiply until the embryonic cells burst  after that  scientists remove whats left of the human cell material through rigorous purification process  what happens is they grow the virus through those  human  cells  they then harvest the virus  filter all of that material  what you get in your vaccine is actually the virus thats been engineered  adalja told charlottes nbc affiliate news station Â  so  in short  the human cell lines do not end up in the final j j vaccine product but rather serve as incubators to create biological material to fight the virus that causes covid    symptoms  this cell line enables us to rapidly manufacture hundreds of millions of single shot covid vaccines that can be transferred and stored without the need for deep freezing  j j told snopes  furthermore  it was erroneous to think virologists took the above referenced embryonic cells  which scientists call per c  in j js process  directly from aborted fetal tissue  or that j j relied on steady supply of aborted fetuses to make its shots  instead  per c  cells are the multi generational offspring of colony of fetal cell line that originated with one    week old fetus aborted in      and serve various purposes in biology research   its  important to realize that fetal cell lines have been used  and will continue to be used  Â in many biotechnological applications  adalja wrote in an email to snopes  for those reasons  we rate this claim false  while testing covid    vaccine formulas  j js competitors  pfizer biontech and moderna  also made use of human fetal cells  the catholic church  however  considered their process less morally egregious than j js  according to the statement by the u s  bishops  it read   it  is morally acceptable to receive covid    vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process     however  if one can choose among equally safe and effective covid    vaccines  the vaccine with the least connection to abortion derived cell lines should be chosen  therefore  if one has the ability to choose vaccine  pfizer or modernas vaccines should be chosen over johnson   johnsons  in other words  the bishops recirculated the vaticans message  people have the moral duty to protect their own health and should get vaccinated to prevent the spread of covid     and  as result  people should not hesitate to accept johnson   johnson shots if theyre the only type of immunization offered to them  one day after the statement  npr reported leader of catholic hospital in the maryland suburbs said providers were indeed distributing     doses of the j j vaccine  regardless of the fetal cell debate  cell lines are not primary concern when you have the greater issue of saving lives  rev  kirtley yearwood said  in reality  americans who are eligible for vaccinations generally have no choice of which vaccine they receive  federal  state  and local health authorities decide how  and where  to distribute the shots  as of this writing  the u s  federal government was preparing to purchase     million doses of the j j as part of its effort to provide covid    vaccinations to all americans who

until       michael yeadon worked in drug discovery research unit within pfizer and was vice president and chief scientist of that specific division  which focused on allergy and respiratory medical research  his views on covid     lockdowns  and vaccination have elevated his position on some corners of the internet  despite scientific rationale for those claims that has since been proven to be unambiguously incorrect   yeadon s title was not  chief scientist of pfizer    chief scientific officer of pfizer   or  vice president of pfizer   the division he ran had nothing to do with vaccines or infectious disease and at the time of its closure in       was focused on developing compounds that targeted asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  anti vaccine and medical conspiracy theory websites often cite former pfizer employee named michael yeadon as their source  yeadon  who left pfizer in       has made several controversial claims since the start of the covid    pandemic  as vaccination efforts ramp up across the world  statement he made in october      is being reshared in meme form to sow doubt about the necessity of vaccination   narrowly speaking  this fact check concerns the accuracy of the title media reports and memes have ascribed to yeadon  which generally identify him as some variation as the former chief science officer  chief scientist  or vice president of pfizer Â  while yeadon himself has not presented his credentials in that manner  reports ascribing such titles to him add gravitas to his inaccurate claims about covid     more broadly speaking  however  the reemergence of his five month old quote offers great opportunity to see how yeadons oft cited pronouncements about the covid    pandemic have held up  as it turns out  they have been  to put it mildly  alarmingly incorrect  the quote on vaccines stems from broader argument he made that claimed  due to purported preexisting immunity to covid     that the pandemic ended in october and that there would be no second wave globally or in his home county of the u k  in other words  regardless of who he is or where he once worked  yeadons argument that there is no need for vaccines relies on series of assumptions that predicted the worst of the pandemic was behind us in october       as that claim is self evidently ridiculous  his conclusion on vaccines is entirely without merit  viruses do not do waves  yeadon wrote about two months before the second covid    wave dwarfed anything the u k had seen previously during the pandemic Â  Â  in reality  scientist named mikael dolsten has served as the chief scientific officer for pfizer since may       when he replaced man named martin mackay  in dolstens capacity as chief scientific officer  he is president of pfizers worldwide research  development and medical  wrdm  organization  pfizers wrdm has historically contained several different therapeutic area research units  until       one of those was the allergy and respiratory unit  it was this specific division within pfizers wrdm that yeadon served as vice president and chief scientific officer  dolsten significantly downsized the number of wrdm therapeutic areas at pfizer  and the company closed the u k  based allergy and respiratory unit in       at the time of its closure  yeadons unit was focused on developing compounds that target two of these diseases that affect the lower airways  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  copd  and also diseases of the pulmonary vasculature  according to      pfizer report  the yeadon quote  commonly presented in an anti vaccine context  was taken from an oct           post yeadon wrote on u k  based blog named lockdown sceptics  in that piece  he argued that the u ks scientific advisory group for emergencies  sage   medical body that makes recommendations about lockdowns and other covid    health measures  relied on faulty numbers to calculate the level of risk posed by covid     he argued the groups models were fatally flawed because they did not account for people previously exposed to other milder coronaviruses that imparted some level of protective immunity  and because they relied on blood antibody tests that did not detect the specific antibodies imparted by these milder coronaviruses  broadly termed common cold coronaviruses  cccs   yeadons arguments referenced research or reporting that came out in august and september       at the time  studies showed that blood taken from dialysis patients before the pandemic demonstrated that large portion of the populations immune systems already possessed some ability to at least recognize and fight sars cov    which is the virus that caused covid     it is hypothesized  but not yet proven  the august      studys authors wrote  that this might be due to immunity to cccs  such findings  september      bmj editorial posited  may force pandemic planners to revisit some of their foundational assumptions about how to measure population susceptibility  due to this purported pre existing immunity  yeadon argued that in october      about     of the globe had some level of immunity to covid    as opposed to the    estimated by sage  based on this belief  yeadon wrote that there is absolutely no need for vaccines to extinguish the pandemic  he argued that at national level  the greatly reduced proportion of the population that remains susceptible now means we will not see another large  national scale outbreak of covid     to take yeadons october      statement about vaccines seriously  therefore  one also has to defend the claim that second coronavirus wave never hit the u k  such claim is comically indefensible  the chart below shows new covid    cases in the u k  by day  the highlighted data point  oct            is the day yeadon published his article  that large spike beginning in december is the second wave that yeadon said would never come   yeadon structured his article by highlighting what he believed to be flawed assumptions made by sage  it is perhaps ironic  then  that flawed assumption is what led yeadon awry  yeadons assumption  one that the very papers he referenced cautioned againstÂ making Â  was that the antibodies potentially derived from previous cccs can effectively or meaningfully prevent infection from sars cov    by december       it became clear that this was not the case  in november      commentary piece concerning preexisting immunity to covid    published in the medical journal jama  public health officials and immunologists concluded that achieving herd immunity through natural infections will take years of painful sacrifice that are tallied in numerous deaths  severe long term health sequelae  and widespread economic disruption and hardship  the only hope to avoid such an outcome  the authors concluded  was vaccination  let us hope that safe and effective vaccines help avoid the consequences of naturally developing herd immunity to covid     the authors of the piece wrote in november       at the time of this reporting  those vaccines appear to be doing just that  broadly speaking  the argument yeadon made to caution against vaccines is based on conclusions which the passage of time has already exposed as woefully misguided  narrowly speaking  however  the claim that former chief scientist or vice president of pfizer made these vaccine skeptical comments is mostly false because yeadon  while being employed by pfizer  never held such senior position at the company,[1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
a long winded statement from the kenya catholic doctors association raised eyebrows  and sparked concerns about fuelling vaccine hesitancy   the doctors  who say they follow catholic values when practising  made misleading claims about drugs that have been repurposed to treat covid     catholic bishops say the doctors do not speak for the church  and urged kenyans to consider taking vaccines for covid     experts also said that vaccines are effective and have been used to control other outbreaks  incorrect information shared by influential people poses threat to vaccine acceptance  day after kenya took delivery of million doses of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine for covid     group of catholic doctors weighed in Â  the vaccine was unnecessary and it should not be given  the kenya catholic doctors association said in   march      advisory  suggesting alternative treatments  the advice by the group  which says it works to expose falsehoods in medical practice  was quickly criticised by other doctors for being misleading  and in   march statement  catholic church leaders said the doctors were speaking in their own capacity  all covid    vaccines vetted by the health ministry were licit and ethically acceptable and kenyans should be encouraged to take them  even if on voluntary basis  estimates vary  but data firm statista says that as of      some     of kenyas      million people were catholics  earlier senior catholic archbishop anthony muheria said pope francis  the global head of the church  had taken vaccine  as had his predecessor  pope benedict xvi  the world health organization  who  also issued statement on the falsehoods and uncertainties being circulated about this vaccine as unnecessary  questionable or unsafe  the    page advisory from the kenya catholic doctors association is in places rambling  and makes some sweeping statements  for example  it works out global crude mortality rate of        more accurately case fatality ratio  and says this means your chances of survival in the midst of this disease in this world is        Â  the group also made other claims that have since been debunked by other fact checkers  such as comparing long standing diseases with an emerging one  covid    Â  we isolated three other significant claims in the advisory and asked experts about their accuracy  we know for fact that there are drugs that have been repurposed and used effectively to treat covid     the doctors statement was signed by association chairman dr stephen karanja  asked for his evidence  karanja told africa check the advisory is meant for general understanding by any sensible person who can read english  if you want research papers  get them from scientific journals currently in the public domain  he said via text  the doctors claimed the whos guidelines indicating that there isnt an effective treatment for covid    were outdated  instead  they suggested that the drug ivermectin be used as prevention  combination of hydroxychloroquine  zinc and azithromycin was another treatment option  they said  ivermectin is used to treat parasitic diseases and some skin conditions  the who has not not made any recommendation on its use to treat covid     the agency said in its statement Â  research is still being conducted on the drugs abilities against covid    and the who would review the findings of such studies  currently  the only therapeutic recommended by the who after scientific review is dexamethasone  which is now widely used across the world and in kenya for the treatment of severe covid   cases  the agency said  as yet no other therapeutic has been found to be effective  there is insufficient evidence based data at this time to show ivermectins beneficial effect  prof eftyxia vardas  clinical virologist with lancet laboratories in south africa  told africa check  review of available research has shown suggestive positive trend  but there is absolutely not enough for this drug to be repurposed and used routinely in covid    patients  vardas said  dr brenda kubheka  clinical risk and ethics expert at health iq  healthcare consultancy in johannesburg  south africa  said there were also concerns about patient safety and legal liability for those who prescribe ivermectin  there are very clear international guidelines based on evidence that show that hydroxychloroquine does not work against covid    and it is detrimental and causes renal failure in covid    patients given this drug  vardas said  in july      the who said it was immediately stopping its research into the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus  claims about the effectiveness and safety of drugs  new or repurposing should be supported by evidence from clinical trials  kubheka told africa check via email  doctors and patients should conduct risk benefit analysis to avoid raising false hopes and account for the possible harm and futility  she said Â Â  vardas  who said the information in the advisory was mix of semi truths and falsehoods  gave remdesivir and tocilizumab as some of the drugs that do show benefit in severe covid patients  remdesivir is an antiviral medication first developed to treat infection by range of viruses  including that which causes hepatitis  while tocilizumab is used to treat arthritis among other conditions Â  while it is correct that there are drugs that have been repurposed for covid    treatment  the catholic doctors are wrong that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are among those Â  the doctors also inaccurately present claims about the effectiveness of repurposed drugs  we therefore rate this claim as misleading  we also know that vaccination for this disease is totally unnecessary  karanja told africa check that the advisorys goal was to reduce morbidity and mortality among the very few kenyans who need help  but kenyas catholic bishops echoed december      communique by the church that vaccination protected both ones health and that of the community Â  covid    vaccines are completely necessary to reach herd immunity of    to     and thus interrupt natural transmission of this virus  vardas told africa check  and there is evidence for the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing transmission of covid     and also in reducing the likelihood of people getting the infection  kubheka said  it was vital that individuals at high infection risk  such as health workers and the elderly  be provided with the appropriate scientific information to empower them and facilitate informed decision making about their health and the people around them  she said  incorrect information shared by influential people also poses threat to vaccine acceptance  and it may fuel hesitancy   vaccines have never been used to control outbreaks  together with the protective measures of washing hands  keeping distance and wearing mask  covid    vaccines are an additional critical tool of protection  according to the who  kubheka gave the example of the influenza  h n   outbreak in the united states from      to      and directed africa check to      study by the us centers for disease control and prevention that shows how vaccine was used to control the outbreak  the study attributed the effectiveness of the control programme to the amount of vaccine that was available earlier in the outbreak  said vardas  vaccines are routinely used to prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles  polio  smallpox  seasonal influenza and h n  influenza  kubheka did add that vaccines alone can never control disease outbreaks and that many other public health interventions are needed  these include preventing transmission  achieving containment  effective surveillance and continuous research Â  we also rate this

      times on instagram as of march          more than         covid    cases and        deaths have been recorded in canada  as of early march  almost four percent of canadians have received at least one dose of vaccine against covid     also read  video of person having seizure falsely shared as effects of covid    vaccine the video was posted by chris saccoccia  known on social media as chris sky  saccoccia was charged in october      with violating the quarantine act  which requires isolation after foreign travel  he has regularly participated in protests against anti covid measures in ontario  in the video  he makes several false claims  which afp examines below  saccoccia claims   the canadian covid vaccine is the only vaccine in history with mrna technology  that s not vaccine  that s artificial dna they inject into your body to reprogram your own body s dna to produce so called antibodies to the coronavirus  it s never been used before in humans  it s never passed animal trials because it killed all the animals   several covid    vaccines are being administered or are in trials around the world  in december  the pfizer biontech shot using mrna technology was authorized in canada  followed by moderna s mrna vaccine  both are       percent effective  although the covid    vaccines are the first using the cutting edge messenger ribonucleic acid  mrna  technology to be approved and distributed globally  research on using mrna technology for vaccines started in the early     s and included promising tests on animals   mrna vaccines have elicited potent immunity against infectious disease targets in animal models of influenza virus  zika virus  rabies virus and others  especially in recent years   said an article published on january          on nature s website  alison thompson  associate professor at the leslie dan faculty of pharmacy with the university of toronto  told afp in an email that  while the pfizer and moderna vaccines are indeed the first successful mrna vaccines  the technology has been used for decades   also read  images of german official getting different vaccines shared with false claim thompson also rejected the claim that the shots alter human genetic makeup  saying   the technology does not reprogram our dna   an mrna vaccine does not contain any protein from the virus itself  but rather the genetic instructions for the body to synthesize viral protein so that the immune system learns how to defend itself  it differs from regular vaccines in that instead of confronting the immune system with part of virus in weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies  it introduces  blueprint  of the spike protein  part of the virus that the body can then recognize and fight when confronted by it later   kelly mcnagny  professor in the department of medical genetics at the university of british columbia  agreed that the claim is false  he added in an email that the product has been subjected to plenty of animal testing   and it is indeed vaccine  it is not reprogramming anything but merely generating an antibody and t cell response to foreign protein as all vaccines do   the mrna covid    vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials  according to matthew miller  associate professor with the department of biochemistry   biomedical science at mcmaster university  who explained that  mrna is the code for proteins  it does not alter the dna of your cells  indeed  your cells naturally make mrna from dna   he said that  these vaccines have an excellent safety profile as demonstrated by phase i through iii clinical trials in humans   university of toronto s thompson added that  there are unprecedented resources  being spent internationally to monitor any potential concerns over safety and effectiveness of the vaccines   given the many millions of doses that have been given so far  we would know by now if there were serious safety issues  what remains to be seen is how effective these vaccines are in the long term   she said  also read  no scientific proof to claim covid    vaccines cause miscarriages more than     million doses of the covid    vaccines have been administered around the world so far  afp previously debunked similar claim here  saccoccia further claims   they tell you you re still contagious after you vaccinate so you re going to have to still wear mask  so you re going to take vaccine that makes you contagious to your friends and family when you otherwise weren t   experts say that even if people get the shot they could still contract the disease and infect others  so the mask is precaution against possible asymptomatic transmission  while also helping to protect the vaccine recipient until the body s immune response kicks in  but mcmaster university s miller said it is false to claim that vaccination makes you  more contagious than individuals who become infected but are not vaccinated   miller explained that  after vaccination  it takes about two weeks for person to generate immunity that will protect against infection   thus  it is important to maintain public health precautions  like masking  especially in the first couple of weeks after vaccine is administered   miller said  johns hopkins university website answering frequently asked questions about vaccines states that masks still need to be worn and physical distancing practiced even after inoculation   the vaccine is not     percent effective and we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus   johns hopkins says  university of british columbia s mcnagny confirmed that the recommendation to continue wearing mask is in part  to ensure that you have had time to generate protective response to the vaccine   calling the claim that the covid    vaccine will make you contagious  totally false   he said that it  will definitely not make you more contagious and will likely make you far less contagious if you should happen to have an exposure to the virus   also read  new  d hospital beds to make death  obsolete   fictional claim viral studies are ongoing to confirm whether covid    vaccines reduce transmission  but experts caution that these are more difficult to conduct than research that only addresses whether the vaccine protects against infection  saccoccia references the us centers for disease control and prevention s vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers  to claim   as of february     the cdc reporting thing called vaers  had over      hospitilizations and     deaths associated with the covid vaccine so far in the united states alone   the vaers website accepts reports on largely voluntary basis from health care providers  vaccine manufacturers and the public  it says the reports may contain inaccurate or incomplete information and  alone cannot be used to determine if vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness   contacted by afp for previous investigation  cdc spokesman curtis gill said   vaers does not determine if reports of death were caused by covid    vaccine   some of the  adverse events  reported could be true adverse reactions to the vaccine  while others might be coincidental and not linked to getting the shot  gill noted  the cdc says on its website that  to date  vaers has not detected patterns in cause of death that would indicate safety problem with covid    vaccines   roderick slavcev  associate professor at the university of waterloo s school of pharmacy  said that when you track millions of vaccinated individuals  deaths are inevitable  but he agreed with the cdc conclusion that  these deaths have in no way indicated pattern or safety concern linked to vaccine administration   no vaccine is     percent safe and effective  said thompson of the university of toronto  who added that the covid    shots seem to be as reliable as most other vaccines  also read  who does not say  child s presence in school  equates to vaccination consent  and most certainly the health risk from covid    is much greater than it is from any vaccine currently approved for use   thompson said  since the beginning of the pandemic  afp fact check has debunked numerous inaccurate claims about the coronavirus  which causes covid     here  the pandemic has killed more than     million people around the

government data shows     deaths and         injuries from covid    vaccines in the uk  this is wrong  deaths and other  injuries  may occur after someone has had vaccine  but this does not mean they were caused by the vaccine  this article was published before the mhra announced possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and very rare type ofÂ bloodÂ clot  which can be fatal  itÂ was correct at the time of writing  our latest fact checks about covid    and the pandemicÂ can be found here  facebook users have shared links to several websites which misreport government data on covid    vaccines  these websites claim the data shows that     people have died in the uk because of the covid    vaccine  and         have suffered injuries  this is not true  these figures come from the uks yellow card scheme  which collects and monitors information on safety concerns involving medicines and medical devices  such as suspected side effects or adverse incidents  to provide an early warning of any previously unknown risks  to do this  it relies on voluntary reporting from medics and members of the public  these reports are known as suspected adverse reactions  or adrs  but it is important to note that just because an adverse incident occurs after vaccination  this does not mean that it was caused by vaccination Â  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  has said  the nature of yellow card reporting means that reported events are not always proven side effects  some events may have happened anyway  regardless of vaccination Â  this is particularly the case when millions of people are vaccinated  and especially when most vaccines are being given to the most elderly people and people who have underlying illness  it asks for any suspicions about adverse effects to be reported  even if the person reporting it is not sure that it was caused by the vaccine  this means that many suspected adrs reported do not have any relation to the vaccine or medicine and it is often coincidental that they both occurred around the same time  the mhra releases separate breakdowns of reports for the pfizer vaccine and the astrazeneca vaccine  as well as reports where the vaccine brand was not specified  the figures referred to by the websites shared on facebook cover the period from   december      to    february       and were published on   march Â  these show that total of        reports were received about the pfizer vaccine in this period  detailing        reactions and     fatalities  for the astrazeneca vaccine there were        reports  detailing         reactions and     deaths  while for there were     reports that did not specify vaccine brand  featuring     reactions and four deaths Â  this means the websites are correct to mention     deaths and         reactions  but they are wrong to suggest these are definitely caused by the vaccine Â  the mhras summary of this data states that analysis of individual reports of deaths does not suggest the vaccine played role and the majority of fatal reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness Â  for non fatal serious suspected adrs  it said they all remain under continual review     there are currently no indications of specific patterns or rates of reporting that would suggest the vaccine has played role  it adds  high proportion of people vaccinated in the vaccination campaign so far are very elderly  many of whom will also have pre existing medical conditions  older age and chronic underlying illnesses make it more likely that coincidental adverse events will occur  especially given the millions of people vaccinated  update    august      line was added at the beginning of this article to reflect new information about vaccine safety  which appeared after it was published  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as partly false                 because these deaths and injuries were not caused by covid    vaccines,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
the xmrv virus is in vaccines  there is no evidence that this virus is present in any vaccines or that it is linked to disease in humans  vaccines contain the sv   virus  there was some concern in the     s that some viruses were contaminated with sv    no vaccine has been found to contain it since       and theres no evidence it caused cancer as some claimed  there is human blood in vaccines  some vaccines use an ingredient called human serum albumin  which is derived from human blood  but the blood from donors is screened before use to prevent any contamination  vaccines cause me cfs  getting vaccine may exacerbate me cfs symptoms in people who already have these illnesses  but there is no data from clinical trials on this  this article was published before the mhra announced possible link between the astrazeneca vaccine and very rare type of blood clot  which can be fatal  it was correct at the time of writing  our latest fact checks about covid    and the pandemic can be found here  post on facebook makes number of claims about the ingredients in vaccines and the reactions to those ingredients  its not clear whether the post is talking about vaccines in general or one of the covid    vaccines  so where we have information  we will discuss both  the post lists    ingredients and    reactions  neither the pfizer biontech or oxford astrazeneca vaccines  which have both been approved for use in the uk  contain aluminium  some vaccines given in the uk  for example the meningitis b and hpv vaccines do contain tiny amounts of aluminium salts  which strengthen the immune response  there is no evidence that this aluminium builds up in the body or does any harm  there is no mercury in either of the covid vaccines  either in the form of ethyl mercury or thiomersal  mercury based chemical   most commonly given vaccines in the uk dont contain any form of mercury anymore  though theres no evidence it causes harm in the amount contained in vaccines  this refers to cell line called mrc    which is line of cells that were originally taken from an aborted foetus in       these cells can be grown and further duplicated in lab and are used for research  astrazeneca told full fact that mrc   cells were not used in development of its covid    vaccine  though they were used to test the vaccine early on  but during manufacturing of the vaccine different cell strain  called hek     is used  which was derived from human kidney cells of an aborted foetus Â  when the post refers to aborted babies being in the vaccine  that is not the case  cells from both foetuses have been replicated over the decades  creating the hek     and mrc   cell strains  so the actual cells used in the manufacture of this vaccine are not directly from foetus Â  while human derived cells are used to manufacture the vaccine  they are filtered out of the final product  there are some vaccines used in the uk that do use these and other cell lines in production but the vaccines are purified so that no human material is likely to be in the final product  there are no mouse brains in any of the uk approved covid    vaccines  mouse brains have been used to produce vaccine against japanese encephalitis Â  according to the world health organisation  most inactivated mouse brain derived products have been discontinued  in few countries there is continued production for domestic supply  although in general these are being phased out  xmrv stands for xenotropic murine leukemia virus related virus  in the late     s  it was reported that this new virus was found in some people with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome  however  many subsequent studies have not always been able to confirm this and many of the initial findings have been retracted Â  the initial findings led to theory that vaccines grown in rodent cells could have been how xmrv entered humans  and therefore caused these diseases  which was never proven  testing has not found these viruses in number of vaccines  its since been proven that xmrv is not associated with human disease for number of reasons  including that the initial results were actually the result of tumour samples being contaminated with xmrv in the lab Â  monkey kidneys cells are used to grow the contents of some oral polio vaccines  however  the vaccines are purified before injection so that none of the kidney cells make it to the final vaccine  there was concern that one polio vaccine administered in the     s was contaminated with virus called sv   which was present in these kidney cells  and that sv   causes cancer  however  no sv   has been found in vaccines since       and people given the vaccine before      were not more likely to get cancer  therefore  there is no evidence that sv   in vaccines caused cancer  there may be trace amounts of formaldehyde in some vaccines  including the hepatitis b vaccine  where its used during production to kill the virus  however  the amount that could theoretically end up in vaccine is not high enough to be dangerous  the vaccine knowledge project at the university of oxford says the human body produces and uses formaldehyde  it also adds that the amount of natural formaldehyde in two month olds blood is around ten times greater than the amount found in any vaccine Â  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine does contain genetically modified organisms  the vaccine is genetically modified harmless chimpanzee virus  which causes the common cold in chimpanzees  the virus has been genetically modified to contain the genetic sequence of surface spike protein on the covid    causing coronavirus  and also to prevent it replicatingÂ  in the human body Â  when the vaccine enters cells inside the body  it uses this genetic sequence to produce the surface spike protein which allows the immune system to recognise and attack the coronavirus if it later infects the person  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine does contain the emulsifier polysorbate     it is there to hold the ingredients together and is only present in tiny amounts Â  polysorbate    is common food additive  and vaccines contain far less of it than any food does  there is no human blood in the covid    vaccines being used in the uk  some vaccines use an ingredient called human serum albumin  which is derived from human blood  but the blood from donors is screened before use and manufactured in such way to prevent any contamination  no viral diseases have ever been associated with the use of human serum albumin  monosodium glutamate  or msg  is flavouring that is safe to use in food  its used in small amounts in some vaccines to stabilise them  and protect against things like temperature change Â  theres no msg in the covid    vaccines used in the uk  there is mrna  messenger rna  in the pfizer biontech and moderna covid    vaccines Â  these vaccines both work by delivering some genetic code  mrna  of specific protein on the virus surface to human cells  the body can then make this protein  so the immune system can recognise it later if infected and launch successful immune response  this introduction of mrna into human cells does not change the dna of the human cells and if these cells replicate  the mrna would not be incorporated into the new cells genetic information  its not clear what exactly the post is referring to herenanotechnology refers to the science of things between   and     nanometres in size  nanoparticles of this size are often used in medicine Â  lipid nanoparticles are used in both the pfizer and moderna covid    vaccines  which have both been approved for use in the uk  to safely deliver the mrna to cells  weve seen claims that these nanoparticles can have negative effects on the reproductive system  but thats not the case  most of these diseases or reactions listed in the facebook post have no links to any of the covid    vaccines  no vaccine is totally without risk  but if someone does have side effect from covid    vaccine  its likely to be tenderness at the injection site  headache or generally mild flu like symptoms  if you do have more severe symptoms  you are concerned or your symptoms get worse  you should call nhs      theres no evidence that vaccines cause alzheimers  there were claims that aluminium  sometimes present in tiny amounts in vaccines  could be linked to the disease  but theres no evidence that this is the case  as weve said  there are no aluminium salts in either the pfizer or astrazeneca vaccines  there is categorically no evidence that any vaccines cause autism  the research that initially suggested link has now been discredited  multiple analyses looking at over million children have found no connection between the two  as weve written above  claims about increased cancer from vaccines because of sv   or xmrv were retracted or later disproved  theres no credible evidence to suggest that any vaccines cause cancer  as above  studies connecting vaccines and chronic fatigue syndrome  otherwise known as myalgic encephalomyelitis or me  have since been retracted  theres possibility that people who already have me or chronic fatigue syndrome  cfs Â  could experience relapse after getting the covid    vaccination  as reported anecdotally by the me association Â  it says  as with any other vaccine  it is possible that the covid    vaccines will also cause temporary exacerbation of flu like me cfs symptoms  and there is also possibility that they could trigger more significant exacerbation of me cfs symptoms  at present  we have no data from the clinical trials as to what happens to people with me cfs with any of these vaccines  according to the vaccine knowledge project  as with any medicine or food  there is very small chance of severe allergic reaction  anaphylaxis  to the ingredients contained in vaccines Â  anaphylaxis is different from less severe allergic reactions because it causes life threatening breathing and or circulation problems  it is always extremely serious but can be treated with adrenaline  health care workers who give vaccines know how to do this  the vaccine knowledge project says that  in the uk between      and       there were total of     reports of anaphylaxis following all immunisations  during the same period      million doses of vaccines were administered  this means that the overall rate of anaphylaxis is around   in          its true that after the pfizer biontech vaccine was rolled out in the uk  two people had anaphylaxis in reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine  though both already had severe allergies  because of this  the covid    vaccines are not given to people who have previously had allergic reactions to either their first dose  or an ingredient in the vaccine  autoimmune diseases include things like multiple sclerosis  rheumatoid arthritis  and some other types of arthritis  which can sometimes be triggered by infections  where the immune system attacks the body  no vaccine has been consistently shown to cause autoimmune diseases  there is no credible evidence that vaccines cause diabetes  rumours have persisted that diabetes was linked to the mmr vaccine used in the us  because it is mentioned as possible adverse reaction on the accompanying leaflet for doctors  this doesnt mean this vaccine has ever caused diabetes  just that case of diabetes was reported after someone was vaccinated  there is no evidence linking the two  weve written more about this here  these describe inflammation of the brain and heart respectively  caused by an infection or problem with the immune system  encephalitis has very occasionally been observed as an adverse reaction following vaccine  this means it occured after someone received the vaccine  but does not always mean it was related to getting the vaccine Â  the encephalitis society says while vaccines are much safer than actually having the disease  they  like all medicines can carry small risk of adverse reaction Â  the majority of adverse reactions are very mild  but can  very rarely include post vaccination encephalitis  the risk of developing vaccine related encephalitis is extremely small in comparison to the health risks associated with the diseases that vaccines prevent  the mhra has monitored number of cases of both myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination  at the time that this article was updated  august        it noted  recent increase in reporting of these events in particular with the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines  with consistent pattern of cases occurring more frequently in young males and shortly after the second dose of the vaccines Â  these reports are extremely rare  and the events are typically mild with individuals usually recovering within short time with standard treatment and rest   any approved vaccine has gone through numerous animal and human studies to make sure it is both safe and effective  the pfizer  astrazeneca and moderna vaccines that have been given temporary authorisation in the uk have gone through many stages of testing in animals and people that have proved this  the results of these studies then have to be peer reviewed  and approved by government agencies  if people died straight after being given the vaccine  or started suffering any kind of disease  this would be quickly picked up by researchers  and use of the vaccine would be paused or the study would be stopped straight away  this is what the medicine and healthcare products regulatory agencys yellow card scheme is for Â  anyone can report suspected side effect for any medicine  including vaccines  and this information is used to make sure that the safety of vaccines is monitored even after its roll out  update

on march          the conspiracy theory and snake oil promoting website natural news published what it purported to be medical shocker with direct relevance to covid    mrna vaccines  the story implied that the mrna  messenger rna  used in covid    vaccines such as the pfizer and moderna shots could result in blocking or altering proteins that the body uses to fight tumor growth  natural news based this comically flawed conclusion solely on news release that described research performed by team at the sloan kettering institute on wholly unrelated topic that was published in       well before the emergence of covid     the research that natural news mangled in its story concerns specific kind of blood cancer known as chronic lymphocytic leukemia  cancerous cells in this disease do not always present many  or sometimes any  mutations or alterations in their dna  this is counterintuitive  because dna coding errors are broadly thought to be the cause of the uncontrolled cell division that characterizes cancer  the sloan kettering researchers proposed mechanism to explain the discrepancy  the scientists posited that mrna itself may carry cancer causing changes through transcription errors that produce proteins which interfere with anti tumor cells  natural news used this finding to suggest that all mrna  genetic molecule needed to create proteins which necessarily exists in all the cells of all the life forms that have ever existed on this planet  is itself cancer causing agent  in medical shocker to the whole world of vaccine philosophy  natural news wrote  scientists at sloan kettering found that mrna itself carries cancer causing changes  this is the complete opposite of what the cdc and the vaccine manufactures are telling everyone right now about the covid vaccines  heres the problem with authoring fear mongering article about biologically necessary molecule  it might make you look like charlatan who has never heard of rna and who  perhaps on deadline  typed the words mrna and cancer into search engine  found press release  and decided that your work was done  below  we explain why this approach failed  to understand mrna vaccine  as we explained in an earlier debunker  one first has to understand the basics of how cells and the genetic material they contain work  cell contains nucleus  which is separated from the rest of the cell by membrane known as the nuclear envelope  and the cytoplasm  which contains several organelles floating around in the non nucleus part of the cell  an organisms primary genetic material is series of dna molecules known as chromosomes that are found in the nucleus  the code contained in these chromosomes  essentially massive library of protein creating instructions  is what is passed onto new cells when cell makes copies of itself  the dna  stored away safely in the nucleus  gives instructions to the rest of the cell on what proteins to build  to make long story short  these instructions are sent from the nucleus of the cell in the form of messenger rna  mrna   which travels through the cells cytoplasm into an organelle called the ribosome  the ribosome is kind of like protein creating factory  and the mrna is akin to work order sent by floppy drive to the factory  the goal of mrna vaccine is to get work order to the cells ribosome that did not originate in the nucleus  instead  mrna vaccines bypass entirely anything to do with the nucleus of cell by introducing small bits of mrna that are able to enter cells cytoplasm pre programmed with specific work order to produce spike protein associated with the sars cov   virus  by generating these proteins  persons immune system creates antibodies against those spikes without being exposed to the virus itself  the only connection between the sloan kettering research and mrna covid    vaccines is that both areas of scientific inquiry use the word mrna  the sloan kettering researchers were studying specific kinds of gene transcription errors that occur during the transfer  via mrna  of genetic information from the nucleus of cell to the protein factory that is the ribosome  as described in the      sloan kettering news release  the length of the gene producing code transcribed by the mrna is often shorter than the dna found in the nucleus from which it was copied  thats because the useful pieces of information in dna  called exons  are often separated by blocks of sequences that are not needed  these unnecessary parts  called introns  must be cut out to make final product  problems can occur  however  if the mrna copy is truncated  i e   missing important protein coding sequences found on genes exon  in those cases  the protein made from that mrna will also be truncated  it may no longer function properly Â  the specific hypothesis proposed by the sloan kettering team concerned blood cancer known as chronic lymphocytic leukemia  in that disease  they suggested  mrna transcription errors could lead to truncated and broken tumor suppressing proteins and therefore the promotion of tumor growth  such finding could be significant  as it would provide mechanism for chronic lymphocytic leukemia specifically  and potentially other cancers in general  that would not show up on dna tests  these findings help explain long standing conundrum  which is that  chronic lymphocytic leukemia  cells have relatively few known dna mutations  the news release explained  in effect  the mrna changes that  sloan kettering researcher  dr  mayrs team discovered could account for the missing dna mutations  the findings are significant for understanding cancer in general  and for cancer diagnostics specifically  cancer diagnostics may need to change to include these previously unknown cancer drivers  the news release concluded  the findings have zero relevance to mrna vaccines  thats because there is no point in time during the vaccination process for mrna transcription error  mrna transcription errors occur during interaction with nuclear dna  as previously mentioned  mrna vaccines dont interact with the nucleus of cell  as such  the process that would impart these potential transcription errors is literally not involved at any point during covid    vaccination  the mrna contained in covid    vaccines is specific  synthetically created bit of code that is completely ready for the ribosome  the creation of synthetic mrna has long been possible  and is common part of genetic research  the process means we know exactly  down to the specific genetic sequence  what mrna is being introduced in our body  because this code requires no cellular level copying before it performs its function  there is no chance for the aforementioned transcription errors  natural news appears to be under the impression it has uncovered huge medical secret about mrna  its claim is comically simple  mrna  doesnt matter what kind  causes cancer  in reality  the research natural news invoked suggests that mrna transcription errors  not the blanket appearance of molecule in every cell in every organism on earth  can create flawed proteins to suppress anti cancer activity leading to or exacerbating one specific form of cancer  transcription errors hold no relevance to mrna vaccines because the entire transcription process is bypassed at the cellular level  further  the proteins created by the mrna sequences studied at sloan kettering have no relevance to covid    spike proteins  after natural news published its piece  sloan kettering had to add boldface disclaimer to the news release  its important to note that mrnas are normal component of all cells and the specific ones discussed here are not involved in mrna based vaccines  like the one developed against sars cov    because mrna transcription errors invoked in      study on an unrelated disease refer to genetic sequences  proteins  and cellular mechanisms that are not present  created  or utilized in covid    mrna vaccines  and because the researchers who wrote the paper that natural news exclusively relied on reject the interpretation made of their work  the claim is false,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

source  facebook users  facebook    mar       Â      review   the rapid development of covid    vaccines allowed the u s  to initiate nationwide campaign of vaccination against the disease in december       more than     million vaccine doses were administered as of    march       u s  president joe biden set goal of administering     million doses by the end of april      to stop pandemic that caused more than         deaths in the country as of    march       social media posts  such as this one  claimed that covid    vaccines are experimental and didnt receive approval by the u s  food and drug administration  fda   which is the federal agency responsible for vetting and approving of drugs and vaccines  these claims implied that the safety and efficacy of covid    vaccines havent been demonstrated yet  however  this is misleading as it fails to mention that the vaccines were authorized for emergency use only after they were shown to be safe and effective during clinical trials  three covid    vaccines are authorized for use in the u s  as of    march       the pfizer biontech vaccine was authorized by the fda on    december       the moderna vaccine on    december       and the johnson   johnson vaccine on    february       all three vaccines received the emergency use authorization  eua   which is distinct from fda approval  the fda describes the eua concept as follows  under an eua  fda may allow the use of unapproved medical products  or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose  treat  or prevent serious or life threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met  including that there are no adequate  approved  and available alternatives   this description illustrates that the eua is specifically designed to address serious public health threats  such as that posed by the covid    pandemic  when swift reaction is needed  an eua can only be issued if the government declares public health emergency  as was done by the u s  secretary of health and human services on    january       an eua is limited and ends when the declaration of public health emergency is terminated or revoked  importantly  any drug or vaccine candidate under consideration for the eua must have undergone clinical trials  specifically  the fda requires data from phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in order to issue an eua for vaccine  the data are then reviewed by panel of leading vaccine and infectious disease experts who determine whether the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks  the fda made the biological and clinical data for the pfizer biontech  moderna  and johnson   johnson vaccines publicly available  these data highlighted vaccine efficacy of            and        respectively  the clinical trials also established the safety of those vaccines  the majority of observed adverse events are mild and transient and characteristic of the bodys reaction to vaccination  they include redness and pain at the site of injection  fever or headache  the clinical trials on the pfizer biontech  moderna and johnson   johnson vaccines all showed that serious adverse events were extremely rare  below    of the number of volunteers  and occured in the same proportion between the volunteers who received the vaccine and those who didnt  control group   this strongly suggests that none of the serious adverse events observed during the trials were caused by the vaccine  there are indeed differences between fda approval and an eua  in an article published by the conversation  christopher robertson  professor of law at boston university and jeremy greene  professor of medicine at johns hopkins university explained that fda approval usually requires two phase iii clinical trials and longer follow up than an eua  however  the fda approval process for vaccine isnt practical in the face of serious health threat that is causing excess mortality  as such  the process for granting an eua evaluates whether products benefits outweigh the risks  whereas fda approval focuses solely on the proof of safety  in the case of the three authorized covid    vaccines  clinical trials and post authorization monitoring showed that risks are very small  the majority of reported adverse events being mild and transient and characteristic of vaccination  according to the university of north carolina health care  the eua also speeds up the manufacturing process for vaccines by allowing companies to scale up production in parallel with the clinical trials  during standard fda approval  clinical trials would be conducted before scaling up production  delaying the availability of the vaccine to the general public  the use of the eua is not new  as several euas have been issued in the past  for instance  the u s  secretary of health declared an emergency in      due to heightened risk of anthrax contamination of military personnel  this led the fda to issue an eua for an anthrax vaccine by eua from      to       several other euas for products pertaining to other public health concerns  such as ebola  remain active  the facebook post also claimed that covid    vaccines are experimental and seemed to imply that people who received the vaccines are in the experiment  this claim is inaccurate and misleading  as it suggests that people who received the vaccine are guinea pigs for the vaccines and that the vaccines safety and efficacy arent established  although the covid    vaccination campaigns are continually monitored by health agencies  the fact that new data is being collected after the vaccines were authorized doesnt mean that the vaccine is experimental  rather  the goal is to increase our knowledge of how the vaccine works and ensure that it is indeed effective in the real world  this continued gathering of data is helpful  as certain populations were excluded from the initial clinical trials  for instance  the phase iii pfizer biontech trial excluded volunteers younger than    and pregnant women  although the mechanism of the vaccine and data from the initial clinical trials dont indicate grounds for concern in pregnant women and children  additional studies were planned in order to gather more data in these specific groups  these studies will enable researchers to better evaluate the vaccines safety and efficacy  an ongoing clinical trial is investigating the efficacy and safety of the pfizer biontech vaccine on pregnant women  while trial of the moderna vaccine is underway in children  finally  newly approved or authorized vaccine enters into the phase iv trials  which examine the effects of the vaccine in the real world  phase iv trials monitor the population that received the vaccine    and determine whether the vaccine provided the same benefits observed in earlier stages of clinical trials  for instance  the ongoing monitoring of the israeli population showed that the pfizer biontech vaccine was     effective against symptomatic cases of covid        the researchers concluded that this result is consistent with that of the initial clinical trials     another study of more than         individuals in israel revealed that the viral load was lower in patients who became infected after their first vaccine dose  when the vaccine protection wasnt complete yet  compared to their non vaccinated counterpart     similar post authorization study of u s  healthcare workers who were vaccinated showed that the covid    rna vaccines are     effective against infection  similar to the results obtained during clinical trials  in summary  the covid    vaccines available in the u s  arent experimental  as they were shown to have met the fdas requirements for safety and efficacy  the vaccines benefited from fast track process in which the balance between the potential risks and benefits is carefully assessed in the context of the ongoing health crisis  the vaccines continue to be monitored after their authorization as part of the usual process for new drug release to improve our understanding of its effects and to ensure their safety

source  geert vanden bossche  children s health defense  the highwire    mar       Â      review   on   march       geert vanden bossche  an independent consultant who previously worked in vaccine development  published an open letter to the world health organization on twitter  in it  vanden bossche claimed that covid    vaccines should not be used amid an epidemic and called for halt to mass vaccination campaigns  the same day  video interview with vanden bossche was published on youtube  vanden bosches tweet was retweeted more than       times and received more than       likes  the video received more than        interactions on social media platforms  including facebook and reddit  the video interview was further disseminated on platforms like bitchute and organizations opposing vaccination  such as childrens health defense  it was also commented on by del bigtree  founder of the anti vaccination group informed consent action network  all of these platforms published misinformation about covid    and vaccines in the past  vanden bossche claimed that global covid    vaccination campaigns would accelerate the emergence of dangerous variants  which will escape vaccine induced immunity and cause severe disease  however  this claim is based on several flawed and unsupported assumptions that invalidate vanden bossches conclusions  as we explain below  claim  unsupported   when we vaccinate somebody  we are turning this person into potential asymptomatic carrier that is shedding the virus vanden bossches claim is based on two assumptions  the first is that covid    vaccines dont prevent infection  they protect against disease  the second is that vaccination doesnt reduce transmission  these assumptions are unsupported  as health feedback previously explained in this review  covid    vaccine trials evaluated the vaccines efficacy in preventing disease  but most of them werent designed to detect whether the vaccine prevented infection  as result  there is insufficient data to determine whether covid    vaccines completely block transmission by preventing infection in vaccinated individuals altogether or reduce the likelihood of transmission by reducing the amount of virus produced by vaccinated person who becomes infected  however  preliminary evidence indicates that covid    vaccines very likely reduce viral transmission  at least to some degree  interim results from the moderna and johnson   johnson covid    vaccine trials showed fewer asymptomatic infections among vaccinated individuals  in israel  one preprint  which is study that has not yet been peer reviewed  reported that infected individuals who received one dose of the pfizer biontech vaccine had viral loads that were four times less than those of unvaccinated individuals     it remains unclear whether this reduction in viral load is enough to significantly reduce contagiousness in the real world  nevertheless  the results indicate that covid    vaccines have the potential to limit covid    transmission by reducing the contagiousness of vaccinated individuals who become infected  even if they dont prevent vaccinated person from becoming infected altogether  preliminary data from countries with high vaccination rates  such as israel  the u k   and the u s   suggest that covid    vaccines reduce viral transmission in the real world  one study published in the new england journal of medicine found that there were     fewer infections among individuals in israel who received both doses of the pfizer biontech vaccine compared to unvaccinated individuals     in the u s   another study showed     fewer asymptomatic infections among people who received at least one dose of the pfizer biontech or moderna covid    vaccine compared to unvaccinated individuals     in march       researchers in the u k  published preprint showing that the risk of covid    infection was     lower in household members of healthcare workers who received at least one dose of the pfizer biontech or oxford astrazeneca vaccine than in household members of unvaccinated workers     combined  the evidence above suggests that covid    vaccines very likely reduce viral transmission  contrary to what vanden bossche claimed  claim  lacks context   prophylactic vaccines should typically not be administered to people who are exposed to high infectious pressure virus can produce mutations  or changes in its genetic sequence  each time it replicates during the infection process  the more infections the virus causes  the more times it replicates  increasing the likelihood of generating new mutations  vanden bossche claimed that vaccines shouldnt be administered during an epidemic because mass covid    vaccination will favor the emergence and spread of dangerous variants of the virus  while viral evolution is legitimate concern  these changes often have no effects on viral functions or result in defective or weakened versions of the original virus  still  some mutations may confer the virus with an improved ability to infect cells or cause severe disease  however  there isnt evidence that covid    vaccination will lead to more virulent variants of the virus than natural evolution already causes in unvaccinated populations     the three circulating variants originated in the u k   south africa  and brazil  which are particularly concerning because they seem to spread more easily and quickly than previous ones  all evolved naturally in unvaccinated populations  several studies suggest that long lasting infections favor the development of new mutations  covid    vaccines may help disrupt this process by preventing people from suffering prolonged illness  contrary to the hypothesis proposed by vanden bossche  furthermore  if covid    vaccines are proven effective at preventing infection and transmission  as the available evidence increasingly indicates  they would also reduce the spread of emerging variants  in fact  history has shown that mass vaccinations are effective in curbing disease outbreaks  such was the strategy deployed during the      measles outbreak in the u s   as well as the general strategy to control mumps outbreaks in the u s  furthermore  these mass vaccinations didnt result in more dangerous variants of the measles or mumps virus that led to worse outbreak  which would have been the case if vanden bossches hypothesis was true  claim  unsupported   all these kinds of highly infectious variants  its very clear  that this is driving immune escape and will ultimately drive resistance to the vaccines it remains unclear how new emerging variants might affect the course of the covid    pandemic and whether such changes will alter the real world effectiveness of vaccines  eventually  some emerging variants could enable the virus to escape the immune response elicited by covid    vaccines or natural infections  such variants may spread easier and faster among the population  causing resurgence of covid    cases  vanden bossche claimed that mass covid    vaccination would precipitate immune escape  allowing the spread of vaccine resistant variants of the virus  while resistance to vaccines has emerged before  this occurs only rarely     contrast this with the current variants of concern that researchers have observed  which all evolved naturally from infected individuals  vanden bossche provided no evidence indicating that covid    vaccines pose greater risk of immune escape than that mediated by uncontrolled viral spread and natural infection  and as mentioned previously  earlier mass vaccination campaigns against childhood diseases like measles effectively curbed disease outbreaks and didnt result in worse outbreaks occurring  this observation contradicts his implication that this risk of covid    vaccination outweighs its benefit  the antibodies elicited by covid    vaccines showed lower efficiency in neutralizing some of the circulating variants in the laboratory     but the effect of this reduction in the real world effectiveness of covid    vaccines remains unclear  covid    vaccines produce strong antibody response against the virus  and researchers dont know the minimum antibody levels that confer protection against covid    yet  therefore  reduced vaccine efficacy against these variants wouldnt necessarily render covid    vaccines ineffective  furthermore  vaccines trigger other immune responses apart from antibody production  such as t cell response  that may not be affected by viral variants       the evidence so far indicates that the covid    vaccines in use provide protection against viral variants  preliminary data from israel showed that vaccination with the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine led to     reduction in covid    cases and     in hospitalizations  even though the b       variant  first detected in the u k   was dominant in the country      clinical trials with the johnson   johnson covid    vaccine and the novavax vaccine candidate showed that these vaccines were less effective against the b       variant that emerged in south africa  but they still reduced the risk of covid    hospitalization by     in vaccinated individuals  these results suggest that covid    vaccines might be effective against new emerging variants as well  according to experts  the key to minimizing immune escape is rapid vaccine rollout  combined with active surveillance of the emerging variants and their potential impact on transmission and disease  this approach allows researchers to anticipate if updating current vaccines is necessary  indeed  the current state of vaccine technology permits scientists to rapidly modify vaccine formulations to improve their efficacy against emerging variants  in late february  pfizer and biontech and moderna announced their plans to test booster version of their covid    vaccines specifically targeting the south african b       variant  the development and authorization of these new formulations would also be faster than that of the original covid    vaccines  facilitating speedier rollout if needed  claim  incorrect   your innate immune system    will be outcompeted by this antigen specific antibodies for binding to the virus  and that will be long lived  that is long life suppression  and you lose every protection against any viral variant or coronavirus variant vanden bossches claim that covid    vaccination would suppress vaccinated individuals natural immune response against future infections with covid    or other coronaviruses is incorrect  the role of the innate immune response in covid    infections is not fully understood  the adaptive immune system  which is responsible for targeted responses to specific disease causing microorganisms  comprises two functional arms  humoral and cell mediated immunity  vaccination protects people from natural infection mainly by stimulating the humoral immune response  which produces antibodies and establishes immunological memory against specific pathogen  this enables the body to respond swiftly and effectively upon encountering natural infection by that pathogen in the future  vanden bossche claimed that vaccine induced immunity will suppress innate immunity against the virus that causes covid    and other coronaviruses  his claim refers to the natural antibodies that individuals produce constantly without any known prior exposure to disease causing virus or bacteria      natural antibodies are part of the innate immune response  which acts as first line immune defense against infections  however  vanden bossche didnt provide any evidence supporting his claim or proving that natural antibodies have role in protecting against covid     experts have warned that natural infection poses great health risks  even for healthy young people  in contrast  covid    vaccines are safe and highly effective at protecting against the disease  while the efficacy of covid    vaccines against the new emerging variants is lower compared to the original strains  they still protect against the disease caused by these variants  therefore  high vaccination coverage remains critical to control the covid    pandemic and prevent hospitalizations and deaths  vanden bossches allegations that stopping covid    vaccination is the only way to avoid the development of vaccine resistant variants of the virus is misleading and based on speculations  current data shows that covid    vaccines effectively prevent severe disease and likely reduce covid

covid    vaccines will change your dna  they wont  the vaccine is being made by mit which is deep state cabal company  none of the vaccines are being made by mit  which is highly respected university  the vaccine has luciferase  luciferase is the name given to the bioluminescent natural enzyme which makes glow worms glow  regardless  it isn t in any of the vaccines  the vaccine has been pushed through in record time  correct  thanks to recent medical advances  new technologies and ample funding  the covid    vaccines have been tested to the same high standards as all vaccines are  covid    is no more dangerous than seasonal flu  false  covid    has killed far more people than seasonal flu does over similar period  hydroxychloroquine and zinc have been used all over the world to cure covid     they havent  studies looking at hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with zinc show no effect either as treatment or as preventative measure  video of man shouting vaccine misinformation through megaphone in front of nottingham hospital has gone viral on facebook  here we look at the claims and why they are  mostly  wrong  the claim that vaccines will change your dna is false  and has its roots in the fact that some of the covid    vaccines  including the pfizer biontech vaccine being used in the uk  contain rna  which is similar to dna Â  the rna in these vaccines is essentially code which instructs the human body on how to build proteins which are found on the surface of the sars cov   virus  the virus which causes covid    Â  this  in turn  prompts the immune system to build antibodies to those proteins meaning that  if the vaccinated person then actually contracts the virus  they already have the protective antibodies which will recognise the surface proteins and attack the harmful virus  but this rna doesnt even come into contact with human dna which is stored in the nucleus of cells  let alone change it  once used  the cell breaks down the rna and gets rid of it Â  weve fact checked similar claims several times before  the massachusetts institute of technology  mit  is highly respected american university  not deep state cabal company  which refers to range of conspiracy theories  particularly prominent in the us  that people in public office are secretly controlling government policy  Â  mit does have some links to covid    vaccine development Â  for example  one of the founders of moderna  company which has produced one of the vaccines approved for use in the uk but not yet rolled out  is professor at mit  mit has also done research into rna vaccines in the past and has been doing research into covid    vaccine development specifically  but it isnt directly involved in the manufacture or development of any of the vaccines being used  the university which has been  arguably  most prominently involved in the vaccine development effort is the university of oxford  which developed vaccine in partnership with astrazeneca which is being used in the uk and elsewhere Â Â Â  luciferase is real thing but its not in covid    vaccines and  despite the potentially alarming hellish connotations of its name  has less to do with satan than with bioluminescent clams Â  luciferase is the name for naturally occuring enzymes which glow when they oxidise  and which are found in various animals  including fireflies and glow worms Â  they were named as such by french scientist raphaÃ«l dubois at the end of the   th century  who extracted the enzyme from clams Â Â  they were presumably named this because lucifer literally means light bringing in latin and refers to the morning star  venus   dubois didnt however explain why he used this word   you can read an interesting discussion on his choice here which notes that the use of the word lucifer to refer to satan  as it does in english  was probably not really thing in dubois france  Â  regardless though  luciferase is not in any of the covid    vaccines  the enzymes have been used and proposed as having applications related to covid    testing and vaccine research  but are not in the vaccines themselves  this all seems to refer to the fact that mit has developed way to store medical information under the skin using smartphone readable dye which is delivered along with vaccine  other claims have been made suggesting the dye contains luciferase  but it does not Â  mit says this technology would improve vaccine delivery in developing countries where it would allow vaccination history to be determined by taking reading directly from the skin  as opposed to relying on potentially incomplete vaccination records Â Â  but the technology isn t currently being used in the covid    vaccine delivery Â  the covid    vaccines have been developed much more quickly than previous vaccines  there are good reasons for this  for one  lot of the groundwork had already been done  years of developing rna vaccine solutions and working on vaccines to other coronaviruses like sars meant researchers had headstart with covid    vaccines Â  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine is not an rna vaccine  but uses technique that had already been trialled on other infections Â  money was also factor  lot of time spent developing vaccines is waiting for funding to come in  with covid     the global need for vaccine was so great  funding wasnt really an issue Â  nevertheless  the vaccines in use have all passed multiple stages of animal and human trials and been shown to be safe and effective Â  covid    is more dangerous than the seasonal flu Â  the world health organisation  who  estimates that each year there are around   billion cases of flu leading to between         and         respiratory deaths globally  even using the top end of that estimate  flu would be estimated to kill around       of people who catch it by comparison there have been over     million deaths attributed to covid    since the beginning of the outbreak in late       and this is despite unprecedented efforts to control the spread of the disease  such as national lockdowns  its estimated that  in europe at least  covid    kills between      to    of people who catch it  though youd expect lower death rate in areas with younger populations  as covid    is much more dangerous for old people  weve written about comparisons between flu and covid deaths in england before  the word transfection  not transinfection  refers to the process of artificially introducing nucleic acids like rna and dna into cells Â  in that sense  covid    rna vaccines which work by introducing rna into cells to produce spike proteins work by transfection Â  quite lot of people seem to claim that this means theyre not vaccines  this is false  they are vaccines  vaccine is product which stimulates an immune response to protect someone from that disease  the covid    rna vaccines do this Â  hydroxychloroquine is drug with many uses  including as an anti malarial  that has been suggested as being useful for treating or preventing covid     it was being trialed for its use as treatment last year by the who but the trials were paused around the time of the publication of an article in the lancet journal by self professed healthcare analytics company surgisphere  the who denied the publication of this article was the reason it paused the trials Â  the surgisphere paper claimed that covid    patients given hydroxychloroquine were more likely to die in hospital than those who werent  however  on investigation  severe doubts were raised as to the veracity of surgispheres data  and the paper in the lancet was retracted Â  after the paper was retracted  the whos trials were resumed Â  however  there is good evidence which supports not using hydroxychloroquine as covid    treatment or prevention  for example  study in the uk looked at patients who were already taking hydroxychloroquine for other problems and compared them to patients who were not  after adjusting for other factors  the study found no difference in covid    related outcomes for people taking hydroxychloroquine Â Â  another uk study from the university of oxford similarly found no benefit of hydroxychloroquine as covid    treatment Â  similarly there is no real evidence hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc may be more effective Â  study from egypt found that zinc supplements made no difference to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as treatment  there is record of tunisian study dating back to may      looking at whether hydroxychloroquine combined with zinc is effective in preventing covid     but it does not appear to have even started recruitment  meanwhile various vaccines have all demonstrated high effectiveness at preventing covid    infection Â  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as false                 because many of the claims such as that covid    vaccines change dna are false,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

source  ryan cole  bitchute  instagram  youtube    mar       Â      review   on   march       pathologist ryan cole gave speech to lawmakers at the idaho state capitol building  cole made several claims about the covid    pandemic and vaccines  several of which were previously debunked by fact checkers  his speech was uploaded to multiple platforms  including youtube  instagram  and bitchute  and went viral  one copy on instagram received more than         views  another on youtube received more than         views  and yet another copy on bitchute received more than         views  this review explains below why several of coles claims are inaccurate  misleading  or unsupported by scientific evidence  coronaviruses are seasonal  they follow six to nine month life cycle  and no matter what we do  theyre going to do what they do  and then theyre going to fade  what happened to sars  what happened to mers  what did we do to stop them  nothing  they did their thing  disease seasonality refers to when the number of infections rise at certain times of the year  but are low at other times  and when the pattern repeats itself every year  this pattern is observed in several infectious diseases  including some common coronaviruses       but coles claim seemed to imply that six to nine month life cycle is rule for all coronaviruses  this is contradicted by the fact that more than year later  covid    is still actively spreading in several parts of the world  including the u s  and european countries like france and italy  it is inaccurate and misleading to cite sars  severe acute respiratory syndrome  and mers  middle east respiratory syndrome  as examples of diseases caused by seasonal coronaviruses  neither of these viruses exhibit seasonal activity  the first outbreak of sars began in       with second  smaller outbreak occurring in      after researchers studying the sars coronavirus became infected by accident  no other cases of sars were recorded after that  if sars was seasonal disease  as cole claimed  new cases would be expected each year  mers was first reported in       researchers studying the pattern of mers cases between      and      concluded that the disease doesnt exhibit seasonality  at least in terms of primary infections     it is also false to claim that nothing was done to stop sars and mers  unlike covid     no community spread of sars took place in the u s   as such  the country didnt experience widespread cases of sars  according to the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   there were only eight cases of sars cov   infection  all of which were linked to travel in areas where sars was spreading  given the fact that there was no community spread of sars  no control measures were imposed on the general public  this wasnt the case for regions that saw sars spread  including china  singapore  and hong kong  all three countries implemented significant control measures to reduce the spread of sars  such as temperature screenings  contact tracing  school closures  and implementing quarantines of contacts and suspected cases     as with sars  the u s  didnt see widespread transmission of mers  the cdc reported that only two people in the u s  tested positive for mers  both in       the global spread of mers  like sars  was largely confined to specific geographic region  namely the arabian peninsula  one exception is south korea  which saw an outbreak in      that was linked to one traveller who visited the middle east  that outbreak was brought under control thanks to public health measures  including contact tracing and quarantine and isolation of all contacts and suspected cases  overall  coles suggestion that covid    is seasonal disease that will go away on its own in six to nine months  even if we dont do anything  doesnt stand up to scrutiny  it has been more than year since the covid    pandemic started  his claim that the coronaviruses responsible for sars and mers are seasonal and that nothing was required to control their spread is inaccurate      of deaths in the state have been over    years of age  thats the at risk population  we have stopped our society for something thats taking people that are already at that death risk age anyway coles statements appear to reference the public health measures used to control the spread of covid     including lockdowns and physical distancing  there have been numerous claims that attempt to downplay the severity of the covid    pandemic by focusing on the disease mortality  health feedback reviewed some of these claims here and here  this claim overlooks the fact that the outcomes of covid    arent limited to either complete recovery or death  while most people who get covid    survive  certain proportion of survivors struggle with long term health problems  which researchers termed long covid  among some of the documented effects are shortness of breath  fatigue  and an inability to focus or think clearly  brain fog   these effects can considerably affect persons quality of life  long covid affects wide variety of people  including those who had mild or serious covid     as well as young  athletic  and elderly people  it is also unclear how long it will take for the effects to go away  as stephanie lavergne  an infectious disease researcher at colorado state university  wrote in the conversation  coles claim that     of deaths in idaho came from those over    years of age isnt accurate  according to the idaho department of health and welfare  those aged    years old and above comprise about     of covid    related deaths  see figure   below    figure    number of covid    related deaths in the state of idaho  stratified by age  data extracted on   april      from the idaho division of public health  ivermectin is effective for preventing and treating covid    claims about ivermectins efficacy against covid    circulated on social media even before coles video  health feedback fact checked the claim about ivermectin in previous reviews here and here  ivermectin is drug used to treat parasitic infections in both animals and humans  the basis for the claim that the drug works on covid    appears to come  at least in part  from study by researchers in australia that tested the drug in cells growing in petri dishes     they observed that ivermectin could reduce viral replication in cells infected by sars cov    however  the dose used in this study was many times higher than doses approved for humans     researchers conducted clinical trials testing the effectiveness of ivermectin on covid    patients  summary of the results and limitations of some clinical studies on the effects of ivermectin on covid    is available on the u s  national institutes of health covid    treatment guidelines website  as the website explained  several trials had limitations  which affected the strength of their conclusions  such as small sample size  lack of clarity regarding the severity of covid    in patients enrolled in the trials  and patients receiving multiple medications at the same time  making it difficult to determine what effects were due to ivermectin alone  because of the poor quality of evidence  the covid    treatment guidelines panel concluded  because most of these studies have significant limitations  the panel cannot draw definitive conclusions on the clinical efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of covid     results from adequately powered  well designed  and well conducted clinical trials are needed to provide further guidance on the role of ivermectin in the treatment of covid     overall  there is no reliable scientific evidence for coles claim that ivermectin is effective for treating covid     covid    vaccines are experimental biological gene therapy  mrna trials in mammals have led to odd cancers  mrna trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases cole claimed that covid    rna vaccines are gene therapies  this is false  gene therapies modify persons dna in order to treat disease  as explained in this health feedback review  rna vaccines cannot modify dna  as such  they cannot function as gene therapy  coles claim that rna vaccine trials led to cancer and autoimmune diseases are unsubstantiated  as he didnt provide any evidence for these claims  you know  do the shots decrease severity of disease and hospitalization  well  they seem to be  but they dont fall under the definition of creating pure immunity and preventing transmission  if youre immune after an injection  why in the world would you still have to mask and social distance  that is an admission that they dont know that its vaccine  although its unclear what cole meant by pure immunity  the cdc defines the term vaccine as follows  product that stimulates persons immune system to produce immunity to specific disease  protecting the person from that disease  vaccines are usually administered through needle injections  but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose   emphasis added  given that the covid    vaccines authorized for use by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  all effectively reduced the likelihood of illness and severe disease  they induce immunity by the cdcs definition  and as sarah caddy  clinical research fellow in viral immunology at the university of cambridge  explained in this article published by the conversation  in reality  it is actually extremely difficult to produce vaccines that stop virus infection altogether  most vaccines that are in routine use today do not achieve this  for example  vaccines targeting rotavirus  common cause of diarrhoea in infants  are only capable of preventing severe disease  but this has still proven invaluable in controlling the virus  in the us  there has been almost     fewer cases of rotavirus associated hospital visits since the vaccine was introduced in       similar situation occurs with the current poliovirus vaccines  yet there is hope this virus could be eradicated globally  in short  there are many vaccines that induce immunity and produce benefits  even though they dont stop virus infection completely  coles conclusion that they dont know that its vaccine because vaccinated people still need to wear mask and practice physical distancing is misleading  similar claim was previously fact checked by health feedback and found to be misleading  the reason why public health authorities recommend that vaccinated people wear face masks and practice physical distancing is because researchers havent yet determined how much the covid    vaccines reduce virus transmission  while the evidence shows that vaccines effectively reduce the risk of disease  we still dont know conclusively if vaccinated people can transmit the virus to unvaccinated people  overall  the recommendations for vaccinated people isnt an indication that the vaccines dont work  rather  it is because unvaccinated people are likely to remain the majority in most countries for at least several months  since not everyone can be vaccinated at the same time  and in the absence of conclusive evidence on the vaccines ability to block transmission  public health authorities are exercising caution by urging vaccinated people to continue to wear face masks and practice physical distancing  to protect the unvaccinated majority  but if you get coronavirus shot  historically  sars  mers  animal coronaviruses    when youre exposed to wild type variant of the virus    months later  the immune system can go haywire  in the sars vaccine trials in the ferrets and the monkeys       of the animals  when exposed to wild type virus  ended up with immune reaction  cole referred to commonly repeated claim that the covid    vaccines will lead to more severe disease  this is most likely reference to the immunological phenomenon known as antibody mediated enhancement  ade   health feedback previously reviewed claims relating to ade here and here  ade occurs when antibodies bind to virus in manner that fails to neutralize virus infectivity  but instead makes it easier for the virus to infect cells  the potential danger posed by ade is one that scientists developing vaccines are mindful of  this is due to previous experiences with vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses  such as the virus sars cov    which causes sars  as well as coronaviruses that infect animals  researchers developed vaccine candidate for sars cov   using inactivated  killed  virus  which was tested in mice  they observed that vaccinated mice showed more severe lung disease upon infection with live virus     in the case of another coronavirus  cats that were vaccinated with recombinant virus vaccine survived for shorter period of time compared to unvaccinated cats     vaccine candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  also failed human clinical trials  as it caused more severe illness in vaccinated people     because these studies highlighted the problem of ade from vaccines  researchers are aware that this is potential risk of covid    vaccines that needs to be monitored  the vaccines authorized for emergency use by the fda are carefully monitored for ade and other severe side effects  indeed  clinical trials didnt show any indication that ade occurs in people who received the covid    vaccines  walter orenstein  professor at emory universitys school of medicine and associate director of the emory vaccine center  stated in this health feedback review  vaccine enhanced disease is theoretically possible with sars cov   vaccines  but it has not been seen as of yet in the clinical trials reported  chief medical officer at st  lukes hospital james souza fact

a facebook post claims that vaccine maker johnson   johnson has failed to update the public on why volunteers fell ill during the trials of its covid    shot in       an event that brought temporary halt to clinical testing  thisÂ claim is misleading  only one trial participant reportedly fell sick  and while the illness remains unexplained  the company released statement of its findings in october      that ruled out the vaccine as cause  the caption of facebook post from february          reads  johnson   johnson trials were also paused  due to volunteers getting sick from an unknown

evaluation of serious medical event experienced by one study participant  while the company said it could not identify clear cause  johnson   johnson indicated that the vaccine was likely not to blame  there are many possible factors that could have caused the event  based on the information gathered to date and the input of independent experts  the company has found no evidence that the vaccine candidate caused the event  according to the washington post Â the trial volunteer who fell ill was man who suffered stroke  independent investigators determined the stroke was unrelated to the

lack of clarity regarding the severity of covid    in patients enrolled in the trials  and patients receiving multiple medications at the same time  making it difficult to determine what effects were due to ivermectin alone  because of the poor quality of evidence  the covid    treatment guidelines panel concluded  because most of these studies have significant limitations  the panel cannot draw definitive conclusions on the clinical efficacy of ivermectin for the treatment of covid     results from adequately powered  well designed  and well conducted clinical trials are needed to provide further guidance on the role of ivermectin in the treatment of covid     overall  there is no reliable scientific evidence for coles claim that ivermectin is effective for treating covid     covid    vaccines are experimental biological gene therapy  mrna trials in mammals have led to odd cancers  mrna trials on mammals have led to autoimmune diseases cole claimed that covid    rna vaccines are gene therapies  this is false  gene therapies modify persons dna in order to treat disease  as explained in this health feedback review  rna vaccines cannot modify dna  as such  they cannot function as gene therapy  coles claim that rna vaccine trials led to cancer and autoimmune diseases are unsubstantiated  as he didnt provide any evidence for these claims  you know  do the shots decrease severity of disease and hospitalization  well  they seem to be  but they dont fall under the definition of creating pure immunity and preventing transmission  if youre immune after an injection  why in the world would you still have to mask and social distance  that is an admission that they dont know that its vaccine  although its unclear what cole meant by pure immunity  the cdc defines the term vaccine as follows  product that stimulates persons immune system to produce immunity to specific disease  protecting the person from that disease  vaccines are usually administered through needle injections  but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose   emphasis added  given that the covid    vaccines authorized for use by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  all effectively reduced the likelihood of illness and severe disease  they induce immunity by the cdcs definition  and as sarah caddy  clinical research fellow in viral immunology at the university of cambridge  explained in this article published by the conversation  in reality  it is actually extremely difficult to produce vaccines that stop virus infection altogether  most vaccines that are in routine use today do not achieve this  for example  vaccines targeting rotavirus  common cause of diarrhoea in infants  are only capable of preventing severe disease  but this has still proven invaluable in controlling the virus  in the us  there has been almost     fewer cases of rotavirus associated hospital visits since the vaccine was introduced in       similar situation occurs with the current poliovirus vaccines  yet there is hope this virus could be eradicated globally  in short  there are many vaccines that induce immunity and produce benefits  even though they dont stop virus infection completely  coles conclusion that they dont know that its vaccine because vaccinated people still need to wear mask and practice physical distancing is misleading  similar claim was previously fact checked by health feedback and found to be misleading  the reason why public health authorities recommend that vaccinated people wear face masks and practice physical distancing is because researchers havent yet determined how much the covid    vaccines reduce virus transmission  while the evidence shows that vaccines effectively reduce the risk of disease  we still dont know conclusively if vaccinated people can transmit the virus to unvaccinated people  overall  the recommendations for vaccinated people isnt an indication that the vaccines dont work  rather  it is because unvaccinated people are likely to remain the majority in most countries for at least several months  since not everyone can be vaccinated at the same time  and in the absence of conclusive evidence on the vaccines ability to block transmission  public health authorities are exercising caution by urging vaccinated people to continue to wear face masks and practice physical distancing  to protect the unvaccinated majority  but if you get coronavirus shot  historically  sars  mers  animal coronaviruses    when youre exposed to wild type variant of the virus    months later  the immune system can go haywire  in the sars vaccine trials in the ferrets and the monkeys       of the animals  when exposed to wild type virus  ended up with immune reaction  cole referred to commonly repeated claim that the covid    vaccines will lead to more severe disease  this is most likely reference to the immunological phenomenon known as antibody mediated enhancement  ade   health feedback previously reviewed claims relating to ade here and here  ade occurs when antibodies bind to virus in manner that fails to neutralize virus infectivity  but instead makes it easier for the virus to infect cells  the potential danger posed by ade is one that scientists developing vaccines are mindful of  this is due to previous experiences with vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses  such as the virus sars cov    which causes sars  as well as coronaviruses that infect animals  researchers developed vaccine candidate for sars cov   using inactivated  killed  virus  which was tested in mice  they observed that vaccinated mice showed more severe lung disease upon infection with live virus     in the case of another coronavirus  cats that were vaccinated with recombinant virus vaccine survived for shorter period of time compared to unvaccinated cats     vaccine candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  also failed human clinical trials  as it caused more severe illness in vaccinated people     because these studies highlighted the problem of ade from vaccines  researchers are aware that this is potential risk of covid    vaccines that needs to be monitored  the vaccines authorized for emergency use by the fda are carefully monitored for ade and other severe side effects  indeed  clinical trials didnt show any indication that ade occurs in people who received the covid    vaccines  walter orenstein  professor at emory universitys school of medicine and associate director of the emory vaccine center  stated in this health feedback review  vaccine enhanced disease is theoretically possible with sars cov   vaccines  but it has not been seen as of yet in the clinical trials reported  chief medical officer at st  lukes hospital james souza fact

sherri tenpenny  an anti vaccine activist and doctor of osteopathic medicine who believes bill gates is behind various chemtrail   g  and vaccine microchip related  world domination plans  has been making waves in pseudoscientific circles with claim that mrna vaccines against covid    will cause potentially fatal immune reaction in four to    months  tenpenny  who has described the covid    pandemic as scamdemic  alleged in both interviews and blog posts that the sars cov   spike protein created by mrna vaccines will cause delayed but deadly immune reactions  the problem is that the antibodies that  mrna covid    vaccines  generate are going to be deadly  she said in an interview with activist reinette senum  and its going to take somewhere between four months and maybe fourteen months before we see the whole ravage of whats going to happen to people who are vaccinated with this vaccine  the most effective medical misinformation  and this claim certainly fits the bill  often blends real scientific concepts with baseless assertions in service of larger distortion  the factual reality tenpenny is exploiting stems from real concerns researchers had raised about the plausibility of creating safe vaccine for previous coronavirus caused diseases such as sars and mers  for several complex immunologic reasons discussed below  pre covid efforts to create vaccine for these diseases raised several legitimate vaccine safety concerns  the larger distortion tenpenny is attempting to push with pre      studies about those efforts is that they were ignored by the scientists designing vaccines for sars cov    covid      and that their findings hold direct relevance to the safety of covid    vaccines  robert atmar  professor of infectious disease at the baylor college of medicine who was co author on one of two studies tenpenny relies on extensively to make her faulty argument  told us by email that their findings do not apply to sars cov   viruses  below  we explain why that is the case   snopes sent detailed list of questions to tenpenny on feb            we received no response  after our deadline for response had passed  an assistant told us tenpenny was too busy to speak with us  but would be willing to speak at later date  Â  since the emergence of coronaviruses  there had been several unsuccessful efforts to develop vaccines against the viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  sars  and middle east respiratory syndrome  mers   tenpenny relies almost exclusively on two papers discussing those efforts to make her case against the covid    vaccine       study on sars and mers vaccination efforts  and      study on immunopathology caused by sars vaccines in laboratory animals  an immunopathology is an immune system reaction that damages tissue  both studies described scary results from various animal tests on sars and mers candidate vaccines  the basic issue was this  the vaccine candidates appeared to work at first in terms of controlling early infections and creating an immune response  however  when animals who had been vaccinated were exposed to either sars or mers following vaccination  their immune systems went into overdrive  causing massive and sometimes fatal damage to the lungs  the reason for these reactions  researchers have come to understand  stem at least in part from the peculiarities of coronaviruses themselves  sars cov and mers cov  which cause sars and mers  and sars cov    which causes covid      interactions between coronavirus spike proteins and the immune system can  research suggests  block the anti inflammatory half of the immune system and send the immune system into overdrive  leading to immunopathology in the lungs  severe cases of covid    often present elements of immune system mediated damage to lung tissue  another proposed mechanism for this damage to the lungs is antibody dependent enhancement  ade   in basic terms  the idea is that some antibodies created to fight these coronaviruses bind only weakly to the virus  as result  instead of serving to tag or destroy the viral particles  these antibodies actually end up providing further access for virus to infect cells  and serve to make the infection more severe  tenpenny refers to this as the trojan horse mechanism  there are at least two proposed causes for this phenomenon  but both occur when non neutralizing antibodies or antibodies at sub neutralizing levels bind to viral antigens without blocking or clearing infection  not only could these antibodies enhance infection through ade  tenpenny alleges  but their presence  in the absence of the immune systems anti inflammatory cells  could directly harm lung tissue through inflammation and indirectly by creating an unchecked army of pro inflammatory immune system cells  for these reasons  tenpenny implies  vaccine that creates covid    spike proteins will generate massive immunopathologic damage to the lungs after someone vaccinated to covid    is exposed to the virus  perhaps the most malicious distortion presented by tenpenny is that the research on sars and mers vaccination was ignored by scientists developing covid    vaccines  in fact  the work she highlights very explicitly informed the development of safe covid    mrna vaccines  when the covid    pandemic was first declared and health officials concluded that massive vaccination program would be required to return global life to semblance of pre pandemic normalcy  immunologists and vaccine scientists very explicitly used the research highlighted by tenpenny to explain the significant existing challenges inherent to creating coronavirus vaccine  september      paper in nature microbiology that evaluated the risks and opportunities for antibody based protection against sars cov    for example  cited the same work  explaining that safety concerns for sars cov   vaccines were initially fueled by mouse studies that showed enhanced immunopathology  in animals vaccinated with sars cov  further work on this immunopathology led researchers to conclude that it is caused in cases where the tested vaccine creates what is known as th   cell biased immune response  an immune response biased toward the production of th   cells results in many of the conditions described in the scenarios presented by tenpenny  including blocking or inhibiting anti inflammatory immune functions and creating storm of infection fighting cytokines that actively attack the lung  for this reason  researchers knew any vaccine they designed for covid    should avoid th   response  paper in international archives of allergy and immunology  for example  concluded back in june     Â  that covid    vaccines should  polarize the t cell response towards type   immunity and avoid the stimulation of cytokines which induce t helper   immunity  in terms of ade  the same research highlighted by tenpenny is referenced in myriad papers concerning the development of safe covid    vaccine as well  citing the same      study as tenpenny  the nature microbiology review discussed above concluded that evidence for ade in sars and mers is conflicting  but that any potential vaccine induced ade could be mitigated by creating vaccine that generates high numbers of neutralizing  as opposed to non neutralizing  antibodies  thanks in part to the work of the researchers highlighted by tenpenny  then  vaccine developers were aware that any covid    vaccine they developed required two things to be safe from the suite of immunologic responses at issue  the production of high levels of neutralizing antibodies and th   biased immune response with little to no th   response  vaccine created that includes these two features  massive body of evidence ignored by tenpenny suggests  would overcome the challenges presented in early coronavirus vaccine trials  in her interview with senum  tenpenny argued  if i can learn this sitting in my living room  reading    page paper and several others  so can they she said referring to doctors who support covid    vaccination  theres nothing special about me  i just take the time to do it  it is unclear how much time tenpenny actually took to come up with her claims  as she appears to have been uninterested in any paper published since the emergence of the disease for which her claims apply  tenpenny  in that interview  makes several assertions that belie her ignorance of post      coronavirus vaccine science  she asserts  for example  that covid    vaccines create non neutralizing antibodies that lead to ade  what were doing with this new virus is were taking little piece of that virus genetics specifically associated with whats called the spike protein  were injecting that into the body  creating something called non neutralizing antibody   this non neutralizing antibody creates something called antibody dependent enhancement  this is aggressively false  both the moderna and pfizer mrna vaccines create highly neutralizing antibodies  had tenpenny followed the development of the vaccine instead of promoting the pseudo documentary plandemic  she perhaps might not have missed the studies conducted on the moderna vaccine indicating that it produces high levels of binding and neutralizing antibodies  she might have seen studies conducted on the pfizer biontech vaccine indicating that it produces high levels of neutralizing antibodies  as well  this reality is protection against the ade tenpenny falsely alleged to be caused by covid    vaccines  tenpennys argument that covid    vaccines could cause immunopathology stems from her false claim that sars cov   spike proteins created by vaccines will block the functions of an anti inflammatory type   macrophages  when you get pneumonia or some sort of serious infection  the type   macrophages are pro inflammatory  and they show up at the infection and start creating cytokines and blowing whistles and bringing in all the things to try to kill off the infection   the type   macrophages are anti inflammatory  so as you start to recover the type two macrophages  come in  tell the other guys to shut up  were here to clean up the mess   when youve got this antibody to the spike protein  which is the full intention and purpose of these  covid    mrna  vaccines  that antibody kills your type   macrophages  the inactivation of type two macrophages is one of several outcomes that occur from vaccines that produce large th   biased response  baylors atmar told us  as discussed earlier  the defense against this outcome is vaccine that does not produce th   response and instead creates strong th   response  had tenpenny researched the actual vaccines she maligns Â  instead of sharing articles from infowars Â  she would have learned that both mrna vaccines produce strong th   biased responses with little to no th   response  in an october      report in the new england journal of medicine  researchers reported that  the mrna      vaccine  i e moderna  induced  th   biased  responses and low or undetectable th   responses  as reported in nature this month  data from the pfizer biontech vaccine indicate th  biased response  in other words  the biochemical requirements for the scary reactions tenpenny alleges to be looming in few months are simply not created by the mrna covid    vaccines  this is by design  zhiwei chen  one of the authors on the other study tenpenny primarily relied on to make her faulty argument  told us by email that we should not copy and paste the knowledge learnt from sars into covid    research  while tenpenny is certainly guilty of that logical fallacy  the larger distortion she has been creating comes by way of omission  by actively

source  anonymous  children s health defense    mar       Â      review   on   march       childrens health defense published an article claiming that    percent of the residents in nursing home in berlin  germany died after receiving the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine  in few days  the article received more than       interactions on facebook and twitter  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  since vaccination campaigns began across the world  many baseless claims of vaccine related deaths have circulated on the internet  in this case  the childrens health defense article based its claim on video featuring person who purportedly worked as caregiver at the nursing home  the video was produced by the corona investigative committee  an organization headed by the lawyers reiner fuellmich and viviane fischer  who also appeared in the video  fisher is responsible for the website     news  which first published the video on    february       both the     news website and fuellmich published misinformation about the covid    pandemic in the past  during the video  the alleged caregiver attributed the death of eight residents in the nursing home to the covid    vaccine and claimed that the residents were forced to receive the vaccine  the german fact checking organization correctiv fact checked the video and found it to be misleading and based on false and unsupported claims  spokesperson from agaplesion bethanien diakonie  the association that manages the nursing home  also refuted the allegations  all questions and full responses are available in german on the correctiv website   the childrens health defense article claimed     percent of the residents died immediately  and    percent were severely injured within short time  this is inaccurate and misleading  six  not eight  residents at the nursing home died from covid    during an outbreak  not from the covid    vaccine  as we explain below  according to spokesperson from agaplesion bethanien diakonie     of the    residents from the dementia living area received the first dose of the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine on   january       however  it can take several weeks to develop immunity in response to the vaccine  therefore  vaccinated people can still develop covid     between   and   january          of them tested positive for covid    and started developing covid    symptoms  seven of the infected residents recovered  but six died in january from the disease  except for two residents who were experiencing health issues  the rest of the residents received the second dose of the vaccine on    january      without further incident  the only events reported were common side effects of the covid    vaccines  such as headache  tiredness  and pain at the injection site  the berlin spandau health department confirmed in the correctiv fact check that the nursing home reported six deaths  not eight  the deaths occurred only in the living area for dementia patients  therefore  the percentage of deaths in the nursing home was    percent    of    residents  in the dementia living area  the rate in the entire nursing home facility was     percent    of     residents   in contrast to the    percent    of    residents  that the article claimed  furthermore  the health department concluded that these deaths were due to covid    and unrelated to the vaccine  translated into english from the original german   gudrun widders  medical officer at the berlin spandau health department  confirmed to us by telephone that the covid    cases from the nursing home had been reported to the health department  all six deceased residents were women and very old  the youngest was born in       the oldest in       all of them tested positive with pcr tests few days after the first dose of the vaccine and then died at different points in time  widders said that there was apparently an outbreak in the nursing home even before vaccination  the first covid    case was reported on    december       the last on    january       vaccinations took place within the incubation period  said widders  in such case  the vaccination could not prevent the disease  the deaths were not due to the vaccination  but to covid     as widders explained  covid    vaccines dont confer immediate protection against the disease  like most of the covid    vaccines developed so far  the pfizer biontech vaccine consists of two doses administered at least three weeks apart  data from clinical trials showed that building immunity after vaccination requires about ten days after the first dose  however  the covid    vaccine reaches its maximum efficacy of about    percent after the second dose  this means that the vaccine cannot prevent disease when person becomes infected shortly before or after vaccination because the body doesnt have time to develop immunity to the disease  in the case of the german nursing home  the first doses of the covid    vaccine were administered only one day before some residents showed covid    symptoms  according to the nursing homes managers  the last covid    test was conducted on    december       five days before vaccination  therefore  it is very likely that the residents were infected before they received the covid    vaccine  the article published by childrens health defense claimed that the video contains de identified footage from the nursing home  where team of three or four people  including soldier in uniform  vaccinate residents  in many cases using force  this footage is    second clip showing resident and two other people wearing purple uniforms and disposable surgical gowns  but doesnt contain any identifiable information confirming that it was indeed recorded at the nursing home on   january       the spokesperson from agaplesion bethanien diakonie denied that any of the residents were coerced into receiving covid    vaccines  translated into english from the original german   it is false that the vaccinations were made under coercion  the decisions relating to vaccination are and were voluntary decisions made by the residents relatives or caregivers  before the christmas holidays  all residents  and their relatives or caregivers were informed about the planned vaccinations through letter and information sheet  medical history  and declaration of consent  they could decide whether or not to consent to the vaccination as if these documents were not filled out and signed  the vaccination could not take place  the correctiv fact check also explained that it is common for soldiers to be present at covid    vaccination points  since the beginning of the covid    pandemic  the armed forces have provided logistical support to germanys health ministry  such as offering storage space for protective material and medical supplies  german soldiers also participate in the mobile vaccination team  supporting civil authorities and organizations with the vaccine roll out in high risk populations  including nursing homes  agaplesion bethanien diakonie explained the role of soldiers in vaccinations to correctiv  translated into english from the original german   soldier from the armed forces wearing disposable coat was present at the   january      vaccination  this was exclusively for the support of the vaccinator on site and for taking care of the documentation  the soldier had at no time direct contact with residents  for the    january      vaccination  no soldier was present at the residential area for people with dementia  the childrens health defense article claimed that the german nursing home wasnt an isolated case because there have been many reports of elderly people dying after the vaccines  the article cited several deaths of nursing home residents that occurred following vaccination in norway  germany  spain  and switzerland  this statement implies that covid    vaccines were the cause of these deaths  which is misleading  as health feedback explained in this review  the claims about the cases in norway  germany  spain  and switzerland specifically were also debunked by reuters and other fact checking organizations  see examples here  here  here  and here   to establish whether vaccine might have caused an adverse event  one needs to compare the incidence rate of the adverse event between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups  review of the available data by the global advisory committee on vaccine safetyÂ concluded that the rate of mortality observed in elderly populations who received the pfizer biontech vaccine wasnt higher when compared to an unvaccinated population of the same age group  the current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail  elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of bnt   b   reports are in line with the expected  all cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub population of frail  elderly individuals  and the available information does not confirm contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events  on the contrary  many countries  including the u k  and spain  reported reductions of covid    outbreaks in nursing homes after vaccination and decreases in covid    mortality among vaccinated vulnerable populations  such as the elderly  the article published by childrens health defense is inaccurate and misleading  the deaths of six  not eight  residents in german nursing home were caused by covid    and unrelated to the covid    vaccine  these infections may be related to covid    outbreak that started in the facility at least one week before the first covid    vaccine doses were administered  german soldiers are part of the mobile vaccination team  which provides support for covid    vaccinations in nursing homes and other high risk groups  however  their presence doesnt imply that the residents were forced to receive the vaccine    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[0. 0. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0.]

that it had not been notified of any deaths occurring in clinical trials of covid    vaccines in australia  joness claim that trial participants came up positive for hiv also misrepresents the facts  according to csl  the vaccine generated antibodies that interfered with some human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  tests  causing false positives  the company added that this was unexpected  but there was no possibility that the vaccine caused infections and follow up tests showed recipients did not have hiv  it is also incorrect to state that australia suspended its entire vaccination program

the oxford astrazeneca vaccine contains viruses from chimpanzees  the vaccine uses modified virus which was originally created from virus found in chimpanzees  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine contains human foetal cells  there is process involved in producing the vaccine which uses clones of cells which were originally derived from an aborted human foetus  but as the cells are clones  they are not actually from foetus themselves  it has been claimed on facebook that the oxford astrazeneca vaccine contains viruses from chimpanzees and human foetal cells  the post suggests this means the vaccine contains animal products  we have fact checked this claim before  as told to us by the oxford astrazeneca research teams  and described here  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine uses cells from the hek     trex cell line in stage in the production of the vaccine  these cells help to grow modified type of virus  an adenovirus  which later becomes the vector to carry the genetic instructions to make the coronavirus spike protein  this exposure to the spike protein generates an immune response to protect the vaccine recipient from later infection Â  the original cells used for the hek cell line came from cells taken from the kidney of an aborted foetus in the     s  the cells have then been cloned and used for lots of different scientific studies  whilst the original cells used to create the hek cell line were derived from human foetus  none of the cells being used today were themselves taken directly from foetus Â  in addition  the vaccine knowledge project also describes that viruses which are used for vaccines are purified several times to remove the cell culture material  this makes it unlikely that any human material remains in the final vaccine  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine uses chadox   which is an altered version of strain of virus which normally affects chimpanzees Â  this is used because it generates strong immune response  and humans are less likely to have pre existing antibodies against it than if strain of virus which normally affects humans was used Â  this modified virus is used as vector to carry the genetic information encoding the sars cov   spike protein  protein on the spike of the virus which causes covid      when the vaccine enters cells in the body  the genetic code is used to produce the spike protein  this allows the immune system to develop antibodies to protect from covid    infection in the future  the modified virus has been genetically modified so that it cannot grow or cause infection in humans  the oxford astrazeneca vaccine does not contain any human or animal products Â  the vegetarian society reiterates this  but reminds people that lab grown human cells  hek       and animals  chimpanzees  were used during the development stage  and that the vaccine has been tested on animals which is regulatory requirement of any vaccine released to the public in the uk  correction    april      we have updated this article to more clearly describe the role of the viral vector in carrying the genetic instructions for making the sars cov   spike protein rather than the spike protein itself   this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as missing context                 because the astrazeneca vaccine does not contain foetal cells  although foetal cell line was used in its development  and it does use modified version of virus found in chimpanzees,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

australian prime minister scott morrison said that vaccines are expected  to be ready for shipping and distribution to priority groups from late february     morrison said date for the start of australia s vaccine roll out is yet to be decided  australia has agreements to purchase vaccines from pfizer biontech  oxford astrazeneca and novovax   vaccine in development by the university of queensland  uq  and australian firm csl was cancelled in december       after it was found that protein fragment used in the vaccine could trigger false positive response to some hiv tests   however  as uq press release stated   there is no possibility the vaccine causes infection  and routine follow up tests confirmed there is no hiv virus present    with advice from experts  csl and uq have worked through the implications that this issue presents to rolling out the vaccine into broad populations  it is generally agreed that significant changes would need to be made to well established hiv testing procedures in the healthcare setting to accommodate rollout of this vaccine   the statement saids   therefore  csl and the australian government have agreed vaccine development will not proceed to phase     trials   also read  rapper pitbull falsely claims covid    was planned as of february           it is also false that covid    vaccine trials have  killed bunch of people  in

australia    tga  therapeutic goods administration  closely monitors the safety of covid    vaccines following provisional approval  and has stringent requirements for pharmaceutical companies conducting trials of medicines or vaccines included in the australian register of therapeutic goods  artg  to report serious adverse events and deaths   the statement reads    while the tga administers schemes that allow for supply of unapproved goods for experimental purposes  the responsibility for monitoring the safety of unapproved medicines in clinical trials sits with the clinical trial sponsor  clinical trial sponsors notify the tga if trial is halted due to safety concerns   there are five covid    vaccines in human clinical trials in australia  according to the national

out and basically suspended the vaccine  why has merck come out and suspended their vaccine  why has australia suspended their vaccine   jones asks   because they realise this is the greatest crime ever committed by humanity now taking place   the claims  however  are false  france s coronavirus vaccine roll out got off to slow start by comparison with its european neighbours  but as of february           more than     million people in france have received their first dose of the jab  according to the french government website  the number of vaccinations given in france  including geographical breakdown of where these jabs were administered in the country  can be tracked here on government dashboard  macron  however  has cast doubts on vaccine produced by british swedish group astrazeneca  health authorities in france have so far only recommended that it be given to people aged under     it follows similar decisions in germany  italy and sweden  despite the european union approving the vaccine for adults of all ages  concerns centre around lack of data among elderly trial participants  fewer than    percent of participants in trials for the oxford astrazeneca vaccine were    or older   this does not mean the vaccine doesn t work well among the elderly  but rather there is little data to prove it does  also read  no  hydroxychloroquine cannot be made at home as covid    treatment in the video  jones claims that  merck  the largest pharma company in the world  says we are ending our vaccine programme  it does not work   and that  merck have pulled the vaccine  saying it hurts people   while the us pharmaceutical company announced last month it was halting work on two potential covid    vaccines  this was due to disappointing clinical results in initial

source  alex berenson  instagram  twitter     feb       Â      review   with the worldwide rollout of covid    vaccines  claims that the vaccines caused severe adverse events or deaths spread on social media  meme published on    february      claimed that person is     to     times more likely to die after receiving the covid    vaccine than after getting the flu vaccine  the meme is screenshot of    february      tweet by journalist alex berenson  who previously spread misinformation about public health measures during the covid    pandemic  the basis of the claim is comparison between the number of deaths reported to the u s  vaccine adverse events reporting system  vaers  after receiving the covid    and flu vaccines  based on these reports  berenson claimed that covid    vaccines are associated with one death per        shots or        complete vaccinations compared to one death per           vaccinations in the case of flu  however  these numbers are inaccurate  as of    february       the u s  administered more than    million covid    vaccine doses and    million full vaccinations  vaers received     reports of deathÂ  following covid    vaccination  which makes one reported death every        doses or        full vaccinations  this comparison is also misleading readers into thinking that the vaccines caused these deaths  however  vaers reports only tell us that an adverse event occurred after vaccination  without judging whether the vaccine caused it  therefore  vaers reports alone dont demonstrate that one vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event  as health feedback explained in this earlier review  for the same reason  these reports dont allow us to compare the safety of different vaccines  vaers is reporting system co managed by the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  and the u s  food and drug administration  fda   the system collects information about adverse events occurring following vaccination  serving as national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in u s  licensed vaccines  for that reason  vaers encourages healthcare professionals and vaccine manufacturers to report any adverse events  regardless of whether they believe the vaccine caused them  in addition  vaers relies on individuals to report on any adverse event that occurs after vaccination  from mild side effects to serious adverse events  since anyone can voluntarily report any adverse event  these reports may be subject to biases and contain information that is incomplete  inaccurate  coincidental  or unverifiable  therefore  as the cdc explains  the number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence  severity  frequency  or rates of problems associated with vaccines  while vaers cannot prove if vaccine caused an adverse event  they can help determine whether an adverse event requires further investigation  safety monitoring indicates that covid    vaccines are generally safe and effective and mostly cause mild side effects  contrary to the claims that covid    vaccines caused hundreds of deaths  none of the reported deaths has been attributed to the vaccine  the cdc and the fda investigate any death report following covid    vaccination to determine whether it was related to the vaccine  so far  cdc investigations found no evidence of causal link between covid    vaccines and any of the reported deaths  over    million doses of covid    vaccines were administered in the united states from december           through february           during this time  vaers received     reports of death            among people who received covid    vaccine  cdc and fda physicians review each case report of death as soon as notified and cdc requests medical records to further assess reports  review of available clinical information including death certificates  autopsy  and medical records findings revealed no link with vaccination  cdc and fda will continue to investigate reports of adverse events  including deaths  reported to vaers  in addition  the world health organizations subcommittee for covid    vaccine safety also found no association of the biontech pfizer vaccine with the deaths reported in europe in very frail elderly populations  reports are in line with the expected  all cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub population of frail  elderly individuals  and the available information does not confirm contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events  in view of this  the committee considers that the benefit risk balance of bnt   b  remains favourable in the elderly  and does not suggest any revision  at present  to the recommendations around the safety of this vaccine  there is also no evidence that adverse events of covid    vaccines are widely underreported compared with other vaccines  according to the cdc  covid    vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in u s  history  in addition to surveillance through vaers reporting  the cdc implemented new smartphone based tool called v safe  this system uses text messaging and web surveys to provide personalized health check ins and allows users to report any adverse effects following covid    vaccination  underreporting is often problem in passive surveillance systems such as vaers  however  increased awareness from media or other public information sources can also introduce bias towards stimulated reporting     overall  vaers is considered highly efficient system for capturing vaccines severe adverse effects     one example is the identification of rare cases of anaphylaxis in some people who had prior histories of allergic reactions  vaers data allowed researchers to estimate the frequency of anaphylaxis in approximately two to five people per million vaccinated in the u s  in summary  vaers reports only indicate that an adverse event occurred after vaccination  but the reports cannot demonstrate on their own that vaccinations caused or contributed to an adverse event or death  evidence from clinical trials and continuous safety surveillance indicates that covid    vaccines in use are safe  further investigations of the reported deaths found no evidence that covid    vaccines caused or contributed to them  besides some rare cases of anaphylaxis  the data so far indicate that the vaccines dont cause severe adverse events in the general population  this explainer from nature discussed in detail current knowledge about the side

despite social media ban  his followers and staff ensure his false claims reaches people on all the platforms  despite having his pages and profiles removed by facebook  twitter and youtube  internet doctor dr biswaroop roy chowdhury continues to spread false and misleading claims on covid     diabetes and vaccines on all the social media platforms  online fact checker  debabrata paul started change org petition in june      and flagged the virality of dr chowdhurys claims around covid     shortly after that  dr chowdhurys official social media handles were either suspended or taken down  but that didnt stop him from getting his message across to his followers  in december       dr biswaroop roy chowdhury published book on covid      called covid      virus and the vaccine  which contained several debunked claims about covid    and vaccines in general  he used hyperlocal news channels to publicise his book  he was also seen giving interviews on various youtube channels and facebook pages  youtube and pinterest have also previously said that they will take steps to remove vaccine misinformation  however  despite the efforts of the social media giants  it seems dr chowdhury has been spreading misinformation on the platforms  dr chowdhury started dismissing covid    as serious disease and made several claims against the advice given by the world health organisation  he spoke against the governments decision of imposing lockdown and making masks mandatory  his book covid     begins with rs   lakh vaccine challenge  where he says he will pay people the money if they can prove that vaccines have ever helped anyone in any way  except for financial gains   the book goes on to compare covid    with hiv aids  human immunodeficiency virus  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome   both of which he claims are imaginary diseases  the book talks about different vaccines used in the past and claims that they were not effective in curing diseases  the second half of the book lists    anti vaccination claims  which are supposedly backed by research paper excerpts  claim    rtpcr test is not approved by fda manufacturer and even the inventor of pcr test one of the fundamental arguments that dr chowdhury uses against covid    in the book is that the tests for detecting the virus   polymerase chain reaction  pcr  test   is flawed  he says that the us food and drug administration has not approved the test and the inventor of the method used to test for covid    didnt say it cant be used in virus detection  according to the doctor  the high number of cases is because the test gives false positives   this same claim was also shared on facebook  what we found out simple google search on the approval of the rt pcr test shows that the fda approved rt pcr test back on   february       the fda issued an emergency use authorisation in february and later in july  it reissued the approval and included two new uses   testing for people who do not have covid    symptoms or who have no reason to suspect covid    infection  the second part of the claim said that the inventor of the test said that it will detect the sars cov   virus  however  we found that the inventor of the test  dr kary b mullis  died in august       much before the covid    pandemic started  pcr is intended to identify substances qualitatively  but by its very nature is unsuited for estimating numbers  he said  an rt pcr test can throw up false positives or negatives  but they remain the  gold standard  in detecting covid     we also took look at the first two claims on side effects of vaccine  in the interest of this story  and found that both of the claims were not true  claim    vaccines cause autism the claim read  infants who received      mcg of mercury from thimerosal containing hepatitis b vaccines within the first six months of life were   times more likely to have subsequently been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder  asd  compared to those who received mercury free hepatitis b vaccines  it said that the claim was based on paper published in      by translational neurodegeneration  what we found out according to the us centres for disease control and prevention  cdc   thimerosal is mercury based preservative that has been used for decades in the united states in multi dose vials  vials containing more than one dose  of medicines and vaccines  it prevents the growth of bacteria in the vaccines  the cdc states that thermisol has been tested several times and has been declared safe for human beings as it can be discarded by the human body easily  the paper mentioned in the claim studied people who took the vaccine from              before thimerosal was removed from the jabs  additionally  the paper also mentioned that further studies were required to analyse other sources of mercury consumption  therefore to declare that all vaccines cause autism is not correct  claim    more vaccine is directly proportional to more emergency care the claim in the book reads  children who were under vaccinated the most had the greatest reductions in outpatient visits  the statements tried to imply that children who were fully vaccinated needed more outpatient visits and emergency care  what we found out we went through the paper that was used to make this claim  the paper published in the journal of the american medical association  jama  was titled  population based cohort study of under vaccination in   managed care organisations across the united states  the objective of the study was to examine patterns and trends of under vaccination in children aged   to    months and to compare health care utilisation rates between under vaccinated and age appropriately vaccinated children  therefore  it does not mean that under vaccinated children required fewer outpatient visits  it basically means that people who under vaccinated their children were less likely to trust healthcare professionals and hence make fewer visits to the hospitals  the book contains many other claims that have either been debunked or are misleading  dr chowdhury  in multiple videos  has claimed that covid    is an elaborate conspiracy by the rich and powerful people  he also met the union health minister dr harsh vardhan in march      to give him book he had written and also to offer his services to help cure covid     his suspended youtube page had over          subscribers in february       currently  other youtube channels like coachbsr and manas samarth  who have combined following of over   million people  host the doctor  simple search on facebook also leads to multiple groups  pages and profiles claiming to be dr chowdhury  while some of the accounts do not post regularly  few carry his interviews on different online channels  we reached out to facebook with list of misinformation still viral on the platform and facebook spokesperson said  we will continue to remove misinformation about covid    that could lead to imminent physical harm and direct people to our covid information center  in december       we began removing false claims about covid    vaccines and will regularly update the claims we remove over the coming months  for content we dont remove  we work with independent fact checkers to place warning labels to help people make more informed choices about what they read and share  dr chowdhury is not new to the world of misinformation  according to report  he has been peddling misinformation about various cures since       despite having no medical qualification  he claims to be an expert in diabetes  his website says that he has an honorary phd in diabetes studies from now deregistered university in zambia  in       the advertising standards council of india banned newspaper advertisement that carried details of his diabetes workshop  he has made several claims around curing diabetes with fruit based diet in    hours  claim that was debunked by fits webqoof team  website called bad science  founded by paul  lists several other false claims made by the doctor about himself and in the field of medicine  the website says that

however  while switzerland has suspended approval for its use pending more trial data  it has not banned the vaccine Â  the second wave of the virus in south africa was spurred by new  more contagious variant of the virus  known as    y v   its discovery convinced local authorities to introduce new restrictions in december      to slow its spread as the country waited for its first supply of vaccines  then  as reported by afp  alarm was raised on february          in south africa when trial of       participants at johannesburg s university of witwatersrand concluded that the astrazeneca vaccine provided only minimal protection against mild to moderate covid    caused by the variant first detected in south africa  temporary suspension of the nations vaccination programme followed the announcement of the trial results  which have not yet undergone peer review  to claim  however  that the astrazeneca vaccine is less effective in general is misleading because  as health experts have explained  it remains viable against other variants of the virus  see here and here   researchers at astrazeneca are nevertheless working on an updated vaccine tailored to the south african variant and  said the governments top covid    adviser professor salim abdool karim  these new generation therapies will have much broader target range  covid vaccines remain effective against existing variants  the next set of vaccines will be made from the    y v  variant and so they are likely to be effective against the    y v  variant  we are expecting two kinds of vaccines  the first are    y v  boosters and we have already heard about the good progress they are making on these boosters  he said in health department statement  you will take the existing vaccine to give you immunity against the existing variants and then take this booster which will boost it in order to give you protection from the    y v  variant  next generation of vaccinations is intended to be much broader and will cover you from the current and future variants  that will take little longer to develop  karim has recommended the country continue using the astrazeneca shots  but in staggered way  starting with smaller population group and monitoring them closely  part of the misleading post claims the batch of vaccines delivered to south africa is close to expiry  which karim explained is more accurately referred to as re test date  because the vaccines have only been made recently  their stability has only been tested over short period and so thats why they come with short date for expiration  karim told afp in february          article  in fact  that is not an expiration date  in reality  its re test date  in other words  you need to reassess whether the vaccine is stable for that period and then you extend that deadline  karim said this is standard of all vaccines and that the expiry dates would be extended as new data on the medications stability becomes available  in order for the expiration date to be one year  the vaccine must be tested for one year and  of course  vaccines havent been around for year  they have only been around for few months  karim added  vaccine guideline

no media source currently available video production  nik yarst shiite religious leader dont approach those who have had the covid vaccine  they have become homosexuals  on february    message posted on the telegram channel of iranian cleric ayatollah abbas tabrizian warned his         plus followers not to get vaccinated against sars cov    the virus that causes covid      do not approach those who have been vaccinated  because they have microchips  they have been genetically modified  the message attributed to tabrizian read   t hey are outside of the human race  they act like controlled robots  they have lost the gene for faith  morality  and decency  and they have become homosexuals  tabrizian  who calls himself the father of islamic medicine  lives in the city of qom  irans religious capital  according to radio farda  the iranian branch of u s  funded radio free europe radio liberty  tabrizian has written several books on so called  islamic medicine  and runs an islamic medicine center  he has previously claimed treating     people afflicted with incurable diseases day  called modern medicine the work of zionists  and rejected immunization as colonialist medicine  tabrizians comments were delivered two days before iran received its first batch of the russian developed sputnik v vaccine  with the first iranian receiving the jab during televised ceremony on february    an iranian health ministry spokesman told afp the country had purchased   million doses of the russian vaccine  rfe rl reports  tabrizians recent statements on novel coronavirus vaccination are composite of old and new covid    conspiracies  all of them are false  claims that the covid    vaccination campaign is part of covert mass chip implantation plot have previously been debunked  allegations that covid    vaccines alter persons dna or can affect their sexual orientation are likewise baseless  in march       conspiracy theory began circulating that microsoft co founder bill gates was looking to use covid    vaccinations to implant trackable microchips into unsuspecting recipients   the rumor began last march after gates posted to forum on the social message site reddit about the bill   melinda gates foundation  he noted that the foundation had committed up to      million to help with the covid    response worldwide  gates said the foundation aimed to have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have vaccine who has received it  when asked to clarify what he meant by digital certificates  the bill   melinda gates foundation told reuters it referred to efforts to create an open source digital platform with the goal of expanding access to safe  home based testing  reuters  citing ibm  noted digital certificate is an electronic document used to identify an individual  however  conspiracy theorists combined misinformation about digital certificates with an unrelated technology called quantum microdots  which is being developed with funding from the bill   melinda gates foundation  one bogus conspiracy alleges that implantable microchips that dissolve under the skin will leave identifiable quantum dots that can be used as form of id  while it is true that quantum dot dye would be delivered under the skin together with vaccine  these signatures are not microchip or human implantable capsules  rather  they would function like an invisible tattoo that emits near infrared light  showing vaccination record  the signature could be read up close using specially equipped smartphone and would not provide for remote tracking  one such dye  developed by the massachusetts institute of technology  is intended to provide for rapid and anonymous detection of patient vaccination history in areas lacking the infrastructure for electronic or even paper databases  researchers and experts said  meanwhile  tabrizians claim that vaccine recipients have been genetically modified demonstrates misunderstanding of how covid    messenger rna  mrna  vaccines work  messenger rna contains genetic code that triggers the bodys immune response against the coronavirus  many traditional vaccines introduce weakened forms of virus to teach the body how to recognize and fight it  the u s  centers for disease control outlined how covid    mrna vaccines give instructions for our cells to make harmless piece of what is called the spike protein  which are found on the surface of sars cov    after vaccine recipients immune system recognizes that the spike protein should not be there  the body makes antibodies to fight it  the benefit of mrna vaccines  like all vaccines  is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with covid     the cdc said  gavi  the vaccine alliance  partnership that includes the gates foundation  world bank  unicef and others  notes that  mrna isnt the same as dna  and it cant combine with our dna to change our genetic code  gavi adds that being relatively fragile  the mrna will only remain inside cell for about    hours  before being degraded  as for tabrizians claim that the covid    vaccination can affect sexual orientation  sheina vojoudi  an iranian dissident  told the jerusalem post that tabrizian is acting like other iranian regime clerics in relating human flaws to sexuality  actually  his goal of spreading nonsense is to try to scare people  out  of getting vaccinated  while the leader of the regime and other officials got pfizer  and they dont provide it for the people with the excuse that they dont trust the west  vojoudi told the newspaper  tabrizian is not the only religious leader who has made such claim  in january  jewish ultra orthodox rabbi in israel similarly claimed that any vaccine made using an embryonic substrate  causes opposite tendencies  homosexuality   tabrizian previously generated controversy when his telegram channel posted number of islam based guidelines on using facemasks to control the spread of covid     those telegram posts claimed that carrying and spreading infectious diseases was unique to women  adding that if only women wear masks  this seems to be sufficient to prevent the spread of the coronavirus  and men need not wear them  tabrizian later claimed that one of his students had posted those messages  tabrizian also claimed that oil from violet flowers effectively combats coronavirus  his suggestion that users dip cotton balls in the violet oil and take them as suppository generated ridicule  he further generated controversy in january      after posting video in which he burned harrison s manual of medicine  leading medical reference book  the world health organization has described the islamic republic of iran as  one of the first countries in the world to experience rapid progression of covid     iran is among the worst hit countries in the middle east  with an estimated           cases and        deaths among its population of about    million  coronavirus related disinformation and misinformation have repeatedly circulated in the country  in march       an unidentified iranian man in qom claimed there was no room for viruses  germs or diseases in the citys mosques and shrines  however  the city was then the epicenter for the countrys covid    outbreak  in april       an islamic

fauci  repeatedly lied to the american public about the covid    pandemic  she also misleads about covid    vaccination prioritization and distorts the findings of scientific paper to argue that face masks do not need to be worn by healthy people  multiple lines of evidence back the use of face masks to limit the spread of the coronavirus  lab tests  for example  show that masks can partially block exhaled respiratory droplets  which are thought to be the primary way the virus spreads  analyses of people who came into contact with those with covid    have also found mask wearing to be associated with reduced risk of contracting the virus  numerous studies similarly document an association between self reported mask wearing and control of the virus in community or the implementation of mask mandate and subsequent decline in covid    cases  while each of these study types has its limitations  collectively  most experts agree that masks are likely to reduce transmission of the coronavirus and should be used by members of the public when around other people  some research also indicates face masks can protect the wearer as well  masks  however  should not be viewed as fool proof  as no mask is thought to offer complete protection to the wearer or to others  for optimal performance  the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that people select masks that

less than     we could find no instance of fauci misrepresenting the case fatality rate  or ratio  which is the percentage of those with confirmed cases who have died  in fact  we found the opposite  before the u s  had even reported its first covid    death  fauci co authored aÂ feb    Â editorial in theÂ new england journal of medicine that said the case fatality rate is probably considerably less than     at the time  the rate was about    Â  if one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases  the case fatality rate may be considerably less than     according to the editorial co authored by fauci and two others federal health officials  including the director of the centers for disease control and prevention Â  less than month later  fauci noted at house committee hearing on march    that the case fatality rate then was up from    to     but he still maintained that the true rate was much lower than that  again  he stated that the case fatality rate misses all the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection  fauci  march     probably for the practical understanding of the american people  the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has mortality of       the stated mortality overall of this  the novel coronavirus   when you look at all the data  including china  is about     it first started off as   and now    i think if you count all the cases of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection  that probably brings the mortality rate down to somewhere around     which means it is    times more lethal than the seasonal flu  i think thats something that people can get their arms around and understand  it is important to note that the case fatality rate is simplistic measure that merely divides covid    deaths by confirmed cases  the true severity of disease can be described by the infection fatality ratio  which accounts for covid    deaths among all infected individuals  as explained by the world health organization  its not lying when someone states the case fatality rate  whether it was        or       and then explains why it is not an accurate measure of the severity of disease  wheelers second purported fauci lie concerns lockdowns  fauci said lockdowns work  this was obviously false  she said  the places with the harshest lockdowns like los angeles and new york city have had the worst outcomes  and no  its not because they didnt lock down soon enough  there is literally zero scientific evidence  and now  nine months into covid     zero empirical evidence that lockdowns work to stop the virus  certainly  there have been debates about whether and when to implement lockdown  nebulous term that has various meanings  but usually refers to movement restrictions and stay at home orders  public health experts  including those at the world health organization  recognize that lockdowns impose high costs to society  and should be avoided whenever possible  but to claim there is zero scientific evidence that the measure works is inaccurate  lockdowns are very extreme form of the measures that we have seen have the desired effect throughout this pandemic  and there is scientific evidence that they work  said lauren ancel meyers  director of the university of texas at austins covid    modeling consortium  in phone interview  as one example  she pointed to study her group published in emerging infectious diseases that looked at data from    different cities in china early on in the pandemic  we found very strong data driven statistical correlation between how quickly city acted and how quickly they were able to bring the outbreak under control  she said Â  laura matrajt  research associate at the fred hutchinson cancer research center who has modeled the effects of social distancing interventions  also told us wheelers claim was obviously  false  she pointed us to several studies to support the notion that lockdowns can be effective  including rapid review of    european countries  which found that lockdown implementation was associated with     drop in the effective reproduction number  or rt  the measure refers to how many people on average each person with covid    infects at given time  number above one indicates growing epidemic  whereas number below one means disease transmission is slowing and will eventually peter out  according to the paper  the findings suggest positive effect of the containment measures on the spread of covid    pandemic  with major effect in countries where lockdown started early and was more restrictive  study analyzing data from europe and the u s  also concluded that lockdowns likely played key role in bringing epidemics under control in many places by late april  no state had an estimated rt below     before lockdown  the authors wrote  but    states reached an rt below     after lockdown  paper published in june in the journal nature likewise found that major non pharmaceutical interventions  and lockdowns in particular  have had large effect on reducing transmission of the coronavirus  string of other studies have found similar results and other fact checkers have debunked claims about lockdowns being ineffective  meyers also batted down the notion that lockdowns dont work just because some places with bad outbreaks have implemented stricter measures  if we look back at what happened in the spring wave and in new york  it was the growing threat to the hospitals  the growing numbers of cases that led new york to enact its spring      stay home order  she said  noting that in many places governmental restrictions are not full lockdowns  that initial wave did subside after people started taking precautions and staying home  the same pattern repeated  she said  with the surge of covid    cases in the sun belt and in texas over the summer and with the spike in cases and hospitalizations this winter   were seeing all over the country that as risks start increasing  policies and communication are put in place to encourage these behavioral measures  she said  and when theyre enacted and people adhere to those recommendations  the virus starts slowing  wheeler falsely claims that fauci admitted to lying when he initially said early last year that widespread use of face masks was not necessary  she says  fauci also said  masks dont work  so please dont buy them  he told us  this is actually probably true of cloth masks  but fauci later admitted he lied to us to manipulate us into not buying masks so that there wouldnt be shortage for health care workers  first  fauci did not say masks dont work  during an interview with cbs    minutes in march       fauci actually said that masks are important for someone whos infected to prevent them from infecting someone else  but he added that face masks generally do not provide the perfect protection from getting infected that people think and so theres no reason to be walking around with mask  fauci still said he was not against anyone wearing mask if you want to do it  although  he warned that if everyone wore them it could lead to shortage of masks for the people who really need it  particularly health care providers and people who were ill  his comments were in line with cdc guidance at the time to conserve face masks for health care workers and those who had covid    and had symptoms  then  in april  after health officials learned more about how much the virus was being transmitted by asymptomatic carriers  the cdc reversed course and began recommending that everyone wear face coverings in public  at that point  fauci  too  began encouraging universal mask use  fauci later explained the reversal in june interview with thestreet  in which he acknowledged that concern for medical workers was major factor in the early guidance for the public not to wear masks  fauci  june     the reason for that is that we were concerned the public health community  and many people were saying this  were concerned that it was at time when personal protective equipment  including the n   masks and the surgical masks  were in very short supply  and we wanted to make sure that the people  namely the health care workers  who were brave enough to put themselves in harm way  to take care of people who you know were infected with the coronavirus and the danger of them getting infected  we did not want them to be without the equipment that they needed  so there was not enthusiasm about going out and everybody buying mask or getting mask  but that doesnt mean fauci lied to us  as wheeler claims  during virtual event with the washington post in july  fauci said that  in addition to wanting to preserve face masks for those most in need  health officials truly did not realize the degree to which infected people without symptoms were spreading the virus  i mean  back then  the critical issue was to save the masks for the people who really needed them because it was felt that there was shortage of masks  he said  also  we didnt realize at all the extent of asymptomatic spread and that person who could be without symptoms at all could inadvertently and innocently spread it to someone who was uninfected  fauci added  but what happened is that as the weeks and months came by  two things became clear  one  that there wasnt shortage of masks  we had plenty of masks and covering that you could put on that  plain cloth covering  that took care of that problem  secondly  we fully realized that there were lot of people who were asymptomatic who were spreading infection  so it became clear that we absolutely should be wearing masks consistently  wheeler proceeds to question why people who have previously had covid    are being vaccinated  and in the process  misleadingly claims that natural infection is better than immunization  why are people whove already had covid    and recovered from it getting the vaccine  she asks  you might say  well  to protect against reinfection  but nope  according to new study published in the new england journal of medicine  which followed        health care workers for    weeks after theyd had covid  six months into the study they found natural immunization was solid  they found only two cases of asymptomatic reinfections  so why are we vaccinating people whove already recovered from covid  they dont seem to be at risk of reinfection and natural immunization is better than artificial immunization  it makes no sense  as weve written  many vaccines dont provide quite as good immunity as that triggered by an infection  but that hardly means going that route is better  as contracting the disease is inherently risky  and there are numerous vaccines  such as those that protect against tetanus and human papillomavirus  or hpv  that produce superior immunity than natural infection   for more  see our scicheck story paul misleads on natural infection and covid    vaccines   for the coronavirus  its not yet known how immunity from vaccination compares with that from infection  some initial signs suggest that the vaccines produce higher levels of infection blocking neutralizing antibodies than those seen in patients recovering from covid     but the strength and duration of immunity from both natural infection and immunization remain an area of investigation  regardless  getting vaccinated is far safer than contracting the novel coronavirus  or sars cov   Â  its true that people who have previously had covid    likely have some immunity for certain amount of time and therefore arent at high risk of becoming reinfected soon  for this reason  some experts have proposed that people who have had covid    should not be prioritized for immunization  but theres no way to know for certain whether person is immune  the so called correlates of immunity have yet to be worked out for covid     and its unclear how long immunity might last  as result  the cdc website states  due to the severe health risks associated with covid    and the fact that re infection with covid    is possible  vaccine should be offered to you regardless of whether you already had covid    infection  elsewhere  the agency recognizes the lower risk to individuals who have previously had covid     adding that its reasonable for people with infections in the last three months to choose to delay vaccination  at least while vaccines remain in short supply  the cdc also advises that people with active coronavirus infections wait until theyve recovered to receive shot and for anyone who has received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma to delay vaccination for at least    days  as those therapies might prevent the vaccine from working  its worth noting that even though the study wheeler cited does suggest reinfection is rare  she botched some of the details  while        health care workers were included  not all of them had covid     instead  only       tested positive on particular antibody test  suggesting they probably had been previously infected  two of those individuals then went on to test positive for the sars cov   virus with pcr test  millions of health care workers have direct contact with patients and are at high risk of being exposed to the virus or becoming infected and then spreading it to others  but wheeler suggests health care workers have been among the first to be offered the vaccine only because they tend to be more racially diverse than other populations  why are young and otherwise healthy health care workers getting the vaccine before its offered to elderly people in nursing homes  she asks  its not because health care workers are at higher risk  theyre not  elderly people are at the highest risk hands down  the only reason health care workers are being vaccinated first is because  as university of pennsylvania professor explained  health care workers are more racially diverse while nursing home residents tend to be white  so  in other words  the vaccine is being distributed according to critical race theory  not according to science  its true older individuals are at greater risk of being hospitalized or dying from covid     and residents of long term care facilities  such as nursing homes and assisted living residences  have been hit especially hard by the pandemic  but wheeler simply ignores that the approximately    million u s  health care workers  who work in settings such as hospitals  outpatient clinics and home health care  are vulnerable group as well  more than    million medical workers  of whom     are white  are estimated to have direct contact with patients  health care personnels race and ethnicity  underlying health conditions  occupation type  and job setting can contribute to their risk of acquiring covid    and experiencing severe outcomes  including death  the cdc explains  by providing critical care to those who are or might be infected with the virus that causes covid     health care personnel have high risk of being exposed to and getting sick with covid     the cdc further notes that because those workers cannot provide key services for patients or clients if they contract the virus and become ill  continued protection of them at work  at home  and in the community remains national priority  it also warns that workers who get covid    can spread it to their colleagues  as well as those they are caring for  who may well have underlying health conditions that put them at risk for severe covid    illness   that being the case  the cdc  following guidance from the independent advisory committee on immunization practices  recommended in december that  in the first phase of the vaccine program  state and local officials prioritize giving the first doses available to both health care workers and those living in long term care facilities   according to the kaiser family foundation  all    states and the district of columbia are vaccinating health care workers and long term care residents and staff in phase   but    states depart from the recommendation in some way  primarily by including other groups to be immunized   the cdc and acip say the recommendations are based on evidence based information about the coronavirus vaccines  with the goal of decreasing death and serious disease  preserving the function of society and reducing the burden covid    is having on people already facing disparities   as of feb     there had been over         confirmed covid    cases and       deaths among health care workers  according to the cdc  but that may be an undercount   in december  kaiser health news said its joint investigation with the guardian found that more than       u s  health care workers have died in the covid    pandemic since march  far higher number than that reported by the government  the news site said those fatalities have skewed young  with the majority of victims under age    in the cases for which there is age data  in addition  people of color have been disproportionately affected  accounting for about     of deaths in cases in which there is race and ethnicity data  khn said  wheeler then goes on to distort study to question why people who arent ill are told to wear masks  speaking of science  why do people who arent sick have to wear masks  she asks  you might say  well  to prevent asymptomatic transmission  but no  new study from the university of floridas department of biostatistics found that the secondary attack rate for asymptomatic index cases was not statistically different from zero  but thats misinterpretation of that research  the senior author of the paper  university of florida biostatistician natalie e  dean  explained in twitter thread that her study did not conclude no asymptomatic or pre symptomatic spread of sars cov   or that masks and lockdowns are pointless  the paper  which was published in the journal jama network open in december  synthesized and analyzed    previously conducted studies to better understand how infectious the coronavirus is within households  the studies provided estimates of the secondary attack rate  or how frequently the virus spread to others from an index  or initial  case  one of several findings was that far more people contracted covid    if the first infected person in the household had symptoms  specifically  the secondary attack rate was       when the index case was symptomatic  versus      when the index case did not have symptoms  while this does suggest that transmission of the coronavirus within households is more likely if person is symptomatic  it does not mean that the virus is not spread from people who arent sick or that theres no reason to wear mask  for one  as our colleagues at politifact and the associated pressÂ noted when debunking similar claims based on the study  the paper itself cautioned that the secondary attack estimate for index cases without symptoms was based on just four studies  and concluded that important questions remain about infectiousness and symptom severity Â  the combined estimate also included studies assessing the attack rate for people who never develop symptoms  and are asymptomatic  as well as those who havent yet developed symptoms  but will  and are pre symptomatic  as dean pointed out  its increasingly clear that people who never develop symptoms are less infectious  but pre symptomatic transmission does occur  and even if less frequent than symptomatic spread  these modes of transmission can still be important to the pandemic Â  if an asymptomatic person is far less infectious but has far more contacts than someone home with fever  dean said  it can come out in the wash  the attack rate estimates  too  are only for households  not for transmission in the community  which is more relevant to wheelers complaint about people being told to wear masks in public  finally  while the mask guidance did shift in response to the recognition that people without symptoms can spread the virus  which by some estimates is quite common  that isnt the only reason to wear mask  as the cdc explains  some evidence suggests masks may also provide degree of protection to the wearer as well  how well it protects you from breathing in the virus likely depends on the fabrics used and how your mask is made  e g  the type of fabric  the number of layers of fabric  how well the mask fits   the cdc says,[0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
by saranac hale spencer posted on february         viral video clip makes bogus claims about covid    vaccines and falsely accuses the government of pure racism for push ing  this heavily on blacks and browns Â public health experts have recommended prioritizing those communities for the vaccine because they have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic  no vaccine or medical product is      safe  but the safety of vaccines is ensured via rigorous testing in clinical trials prior to authorization or approval  followed by continued safety monitoring once the vaccine is rolled out to the public to detect potential rare side effects  in addition  the food and drug administration inspects vaccine production facilities and reviews manufacturing protocols to make sure vaccine doses are of high quality and free of contaminants  one key vaccine safety surveillance program is the vaccine adverse event reporting system  or vaers  which is an early warning system run by the centers for disease control and prevention and fda  as its website explains  vaers is not designed to detect if vaccine caused an adverse event  but it can identify unusual or unexpected patterns of reporting that might indicate possible safety problems requiring closer look  anyone can submit report to vaers for any health problem that occurs after an immunization  there is no screening or vetting of the report and no attempt to determine if the vaccine was responsible for the problem  the information is still valuable because its way of being quickly alerted to potential safety issue with vaccine  which can then be followed up by government scientists  another monitoring system is the cdcs vaccine safety datalink  which uses electronic health data from nine health care organizations in the u s  to identify adverse events related to vaccination in near real time  in the case of the covid    vaccines  randomized controlled trials involving tens of thousands of people  which were reviewed by multiple groups of experts  revealed no serious safety issues and showed that the benefits outweigh the risks  the cdc and fda vaccine safety monitoring systems  which were expanded for the covid    vaccines and also include new smartphone based reporting tool called v safe  have subsequently identified only few  very rare adverse events Â  for more  see how safe are the vaccines  link to this theÂ authorized vaccines were initially tested in early phase clinical trials  in which scientists evaluated different doses  checked for the expected immune responses and monitored for potential safety issues  to find out whether the shots prevent disease and are safe  the vaccines that passed the first set of tests were then evaluated in phase   trials  the moderna phase   trial included about        volunteers  while the pfizer biontechÂ and johnson   johnson trials included about        each  in each of these trials  half of the participants received placebo  while the other half received the vaccine  and the volunteers were followed over time to see if they fell ill with covid    and had any adverse reactions Â Â  the trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards  and the results were reviewed not only by the food and drug administration  which made the decision to authorize the vaccines for emergency use  but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency  another independent group  the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices  also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccines  link to this dr  simone gold  who has history of spreading dubious claims about the pandemic  used misinformation to sow doubt about covid    vaccines in live streamed jan    address at pentecostal church in florida  the video featuring golds roughly hourlong speech has been viewed tens of thousands of times on youtube and facebook  shorter clip focused on claims about race was shared by facebook page that frequently posts about racial issues and describes itself as representing nongovernmental advocacy organization  the page administrators are based in ghana and the united kingdom  well address theÂ claims made in that clip  one is repeat of vague claim weve debunked before  the suggestion that the vaccines are unsafe   for more on this  please see our scicheck story viral video makes false and unsupported claims about vaccines   golds other false or misleading claims are aimed primarily at black participation in the covid    vaccination program  she misrepresents advice from public health experts who have advocated prioritizing vaccine distribution in the communities most severely impacted by the pandemic  which include black  latino and native american people   well get to the statistics next   and she says that black people are being used as unwitting test subjects  suggestion that exploits distrust of the medical establishment in the black community  referring to the vaccine as an experimental biological agent  gold  who is white  says in the video  they are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on blacks and browns  first of all  there are two available vaccines in the u s  and both went through clinical trials with tens of thousands of participants before the food and drug administration granted them each an emergency use authorization in december  the trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards  and the results were reviewed by the fda and an outside panel of experts  so  calling either one an experimental biological agent is misleading  in the video  gold also tells her audience  the reason i dont think this is ever going to be shown to be race problem is things you just know by common sense  one is  its been all over the world  all races  ok  we can just start with that  second is  in areas of the world where people  have those individual risk factors  like diabetes or obesity and other illnesses  and the group risk factors  such as living and working in tight quarters  its not black people who get it at worse rate  its those people in those situations  public health experts have called for prioritizing certain members of minority communities in the rollout of the vaccines because those communities have suffered higher rates of infection and death during the pandemic  gold  however  misrepresents the reason for that recommendation  insinuating that experts say black people are naturally more susceptible to covid     but what they actually say is that social and historical factors have led to disparate health impacts on black and some minority communities  which has led to elevated rates of illness and death from covid     for instance  data from the centers for disease control and prevention show that black patients have the highest rates of both diabetesÂ andÂ obesity among racial groups  which  as gold points out  increases the riskÂ of severe illness from covid     in the united states and worldwide  the covid    pandemic has shed light on the pervasive impacts of social and structural inequities in society  paper from the national academy of sciences making recommendations on the equitable distribution of the vaccines said  covid    is having disproportionate impact on people who are already disadvantaged by virtue of their race and ethnicity  age  health status  residence  occupation  socioeconomic condition  and or other contributing factors  according to data compiled at the end of      by the cdc  black americans had covid    illness rate     times higher than their white counterparts and death rate     times higher  similarly  project of american public media that tracks the impact of the virus by race found that in       indigenous  black and latino residents were at least     times more likely to die of covid    than white residents  the data on covid    cases and deaths across many states in the u s  have clearly shown that across all individuals getting the virus  black and brown people are disproportionately affected by and dying from this virus  renÃ£ s  robinson  an associate professor at vanderbilt university whose research focuses  in part  on racial health disparities  told us in an email  biologically  the virus is looking for host  e g   human body  to attack  she said  in the u s   black and brown bodies have been disproportionately available for this virus to attack directly due to these communities having less access to equitable healthcare  high risk of exposure occupations  and increased burdens of chronic conditions  all directly related to historic systemic racism and ongoing discrimination and social injustices  the plan for distribution of the vaccines  including which populations should be prioritized  was largely left up to the states  though  so  the specific priorities of each state differed  the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices  which issues guidance on vaccine distribution  noted that some racial and ethnic minority groups have been disproportionately affected by covid     those groups are heavily represented in essential jobs  which have elevated exposure to the virus  acip wrote in its jan    recommendation  explaining that those jobs include  first responders  e g   firefighters and police officers   corrections officers  food and agricultural workers  u s  postal service workers  manufacturing workers  grocery store workers  public transit workers  and those who work in the education sector  teachers and support staff members  as well as child care workers  acip did not recommend prioritizing the vaccine on the basis of race  but it did recommend prioritizing the vaccine for essential workers  in the video  gold repeatedly cites report that she describes as the governments words  when she accuses the government of unfairly targeting black people  but its not government document  its report from johns hopkins universitys center for health security issued in august that sought to offer those tasked with making the distribution plan an ethical framework for distributing the covid    vaccine  after noting that black people and native americans were hospitalized for covid    at rate five times higher than white people  the report said  as matter of justice  these disparities in covid    risk and adverse outcomes across racial and ethnic groups should be addressed in our overall covid    response  but  again  that was advice offered more than three months before the first vaccine was authorized for use  it wasnt binding and it didnt come from the government  since the vaccines have become available     states have publicly reported data on their usage by race and ethnicity  the kaiser family foundation found  that data showed that the share of vaccinations among black people is smaller than their share of cases in all    reporting states and smaller than their share of deaths in    states  according to kff  later  gold insinuates that black people are being used as unsuspecting test subjects  if you take the vaccine  youre signing up to be in pharmacovigilance tracking system  she says  its worth noting that popular conspiracy theory had claimed the vaccines would include some kind of tracking device  they dont  gold says that the governments plan for distribution was targeting the black community  which she calls pure racism  she goes on to say Â it means youve enrolled yourself in medical trial   most people are not aware that thats what theyre doing  this pharmacovigilance tracking system tracks you for two years  its set up by the department of defense  it was handed off to oracle and google to put the data together  golds claims speak to entrenched fears and distrust in black communities of medical institutions caused by experiments such as the tuskegee study  gold actually references this experiment in her speech  but fails to explain the difference between what happened then and what is happening now  in       in tuskegee  alabama  the u s  government lied to black men  telling them they were going to receive treatment for bad blood  while they were actually being studied for the effects of untreated syphilis  now  there are two tested and authorized vaccines available to the general public during global pandemic  susan rice  who is in charge of white house domestic policy for president joe biden  addressed the issue when she was asked at press briefing about how to overcome vaccine hesitancy in black communities  she notedÂ that bidens newly established covid    task force is addressing health equity and said  there are americans  and particularly americans of color  who for very valid historical reasons are skeptical and reluctant  rice said that the task force is reaching out directly through targeted campaigns to get to those very communities where the skepticism is highest  and thats vitally important because as communities of color are suffering disproportionately  may have less access to information about the vaccine  and the ability to easily go online  in some instances  and get an appointment  we have to take those additional steps to ensure that they are aware of its availability  they can get appointments and that they understand that the vaccine is safe  it is also false that  as gold claimed  by taking the vaccine youve enrolled yourself in medical trial  taking the vaccine after its been tested and authorized does not enroll patient in trial  the tracking system that gold appears to reference is actually an online management system for vaccine distribution and monitoring  one element is v safe  an online portal to report side effects to the cdc  as weve explained before  trial data from the two currently available vaccines show that many people experience pain at the site of injection  fatigue  joint or muscle pain  headache  chills or fever  which  according to the cdc  are normal signs that your body is building protection  use of that portal is optional  not mandatory  oracle spokeswoman kris reeves confirmed to us by email  cdc spokeswoman kristen nordlund also confirmed to us by email that participation is voluntary Â  Â  another element of the system acts as national clearing house for the cdcs anonymized vaccination data  which means that the information doesnt include patients identifying information  that data will be used for analysis and reporting by authorized agencies and organizations  oracle wrote in press release explaining the system  nothing in oracles description of the system indicates that it would track individual patients  as we said at the start  gold has history of spreading dubious claims about covid     she started an organization called americas frontline doctors in the summer of       although some of the most visible members of the group didnt actually practice medicine on the front lines of the covid    pandemic  gold is aÂ licensed doctorÂ in california  although its unclear how much she practiced during the pandemic  gold told us that she worked at two hospitals in       one of which is about     miles away from her home in los angeles  she also received          in loansÂ fromÂ theÂ paycheck protection program  part of the coronavirus reliefÂ package that passed in march      Â according to watchdog group tracking those loans  for businesses located at the address of her concierge medical business  also  the church where gold spoke is run by rodney howard browne  pastor who has advanced covid    conspiracy theories and was arrested in march      for holding services in violation of public health laws aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus  in addition to conspiracy theories  howard browne mixes politics into his religious messaging  he asserted  for example  that president donald trump should have remained in power despite having been voted out of office  and  three days after she spoke at the church  gold was filmed in the u s  capitols statuary hall after mob had overtaken the building in an effort to overturn the election results and keep trump in power  gold was arrested on jan     and charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct,[1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
facebook meme shared by an australian user claims that becoming sterile is almost certainty for those who receive covid    vaccination  get the covid vaccine but remember the following  reads the january    post  it goes on to list    points  which includes claim that vaccines  have         chance of adverse effects and increase risk of hiv  the post finishes by saying  congratulations  youre

he also posted the meme on facebook  attracting more than     shares at the time of writing  there is no evidence that covid    vaccines approved for use in countries such as australia or the united states will result in sterility  with number of women involved in clinical trials conceiving after receiving the treatments  in the united states  the first covid    vaccine granted emergency use authorisation  eua  by the us food and drug administration  fda  was the pfizer biontech candidate on december          with an eua granted to the moderna vaccine candidate on december     australias health regulator  the therapeutic goods administration  tga   gave provisional approval to pfizers covid    vaccine in january  it is due to be rolled out in february  while the astrazeneca vaccine candidate continues to undergo review  the claim that covid    vaccines cause infertility in women has been advanced by german physician wolfgang wodarg and michael yeadon  former pfizer employee  who asked europes health regulator  the european medicines agency  to delay clinical trials and approval of the pfizer biontech vaccine  the pair claimed the vaccine would induce the formation of antibodies against proteins such as syncytin    which is involved in the development of the placenta in humans  however  dr alex polyakov  fertility specialist from melbourne ivf and senior lecturer at the university of melbourne  told aap factcheck there is absolutely zero evidence that covid    vaccines have any impact on fertility  i dont see physiological way for the vaccines to have any impact  all the vaccines do is create immunity to the virus so it interacts with the immune system  but it doesnt really interact with the reproductive system  he said in phone interview  dr polyakov said there is evidence to suggest that severe covid    infection could affect sperm count in men  but it is unclear at this stage whether this is permanent issue  you could argue that vaccinating against covid and preventing infection with the virus would save the male fertility  he said  the vaccine development was very quick and to assess someones fertility takes at least six months to year and that simply hasnt been done  so there is no evidence at this point that vaccines have any effect  on fertility  at all  and i think its extremely unlikely  in television interview  dr mark trolice  the director of florida based fertility care and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the university of central florida college of medicine  described the claim as baseless  there was scientist in germany that suggested there was similarity in the genes of the covid virus and the cells that make the placenta  there is minimal  if  any  similarity  and the vaccine is not directed at that gene protein anyway  he said  in pfizers vaccine trial  four pregnancies were reported in women who received the immunisation before their last period  page      while two pregnancies were reported in women who received the immunisation before their last period during modernas trial  page      both results were in line with results in the placebo groups  in fact sheet  pfizer said there was no data to suggest that the pfizer biontech covid    vaccine caused infertility  it has been incorrectly suggested that covid    vaccines will cause infertility because of very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of sars cov   that is partly shared with protein in the placenta called syncytin    it said  from scientific perspective  the differences between the two sequences are quite significant  making it very unlikely our vaccine could generate response that would harm the placenta  aap factcheck has previously debunked claims surrounding covid    vaccines and infertility  similar posts have been debunked by fact checkers here  here  here  here and here  the claim of    to    per cent chance of adverse effects stemming from the vaccines has been previously examined

covid     there is no evidence that covid    vaccines cause sterility  experts say protein important in placenta formulation is not targeted by the immunisations  and it bears little similarity to

video circulating on social media claims pfizers covid    vaccine causes people to experience widespread irreversible side effects following immunisation  the video  shared by facebook user in australia on january    features man commenting on data from the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  about the number of side effects reported in patients who received the pfizer biontech vaccine  the speaker says that out of         people who were administered the pfizer vaccine in the us        of them suffered from adverse health impacts  from over         people  on average       people  thats three per cent of those vaccinated  will be unable to perform normal daily activities  unable to work  require care from doctor or medical professional  the man continues  weve just seen now  the cdc reporting that three per cent  will suffer irreversible  irreversible  side effects  the caption on the post includes text that reads  so far    of all people that receive it will be permanently disabled if not dead  thats   in every     people    at the time of writing  the post had generated more than       shares      reactions and     comments  the video has also been shared in new zealand among other countries  the posts claim that       recipients of the pfizer biontech vaccine in the us experienced irreversible side effects to the cdc is false  according to health experts and documents from the us public health agency  rather  almost all of the reported side effects were transient  short term events which only impeded everyday activities for short period of time  these are expected as part of an immunisation program  experts said  cdc vaccination advice states that people who receive covid    vaccine may have some side effects  which are normal signs that your body is building protection  side effects may feel like flu and even affect your ability to do daily activities  but they should go away in few days  it says  as part of its vaccine safety monitoring efforts  the cdc is using smartphone app called v safe  which records health impacts or side effects patients experience after immunisation  cdc presentation on anaphylaxis following the receipt of mrna covid    vaccines shows that         people registered with v safe had received one dose of the covid    vaccine on december           page     the app recorded       health impact events  which equates to     per cent of cases  nikolai petrovsky  professor of medicine at flinders university in adelaide  told aap factcheck that health impact events encompass any event where the vaccine recipient is unable to perform normal daily activities  unable to work  or requires care from doctor or health care professional  typically this will be short term vaccine related symptoms like fever  flu like symptoms  muscle aches  nausea etc   which can last for up to week after immunisation  prof petrovsky said in an email  this percentage of health impact events is entirely in keeping with the reported clinical trial data  prof petrovsky said there were no criteria for the duration or severity of health impact events in order for them to be included in the count  case could be included even if the symptoms lasted for only day  just as it would be counted if recipient saw doctor to get prescription for paracetamol or missed day of work  he said  spokeswoman for the cdc told reuters the figure of         was not the total number of vaccine recipients in the us  as suggested in the facebook video  the cdc presentation said         vaccine doses had been administered by december     with six cases of anaphylaxis  severe allergic shock  reported after administration of the pfizer treatment  page     according to the pfizers covid    vaccine briefing document  there were     serious adverse events recorded in recipients during the phase     clinical trials  however  the company said only three of these cases were linked to the vaccine  which was given to more than        trial participants  page     table     associate professor hassan vally  an epidemiologist from la trobe university with expertise in infectious diseases  described the video and posts claims as completely false  dr vally said the post had conflated anaphylactic reactions  which are very rare  with self limiting and transient milder adverse health events  all vaccines that work induce an inflammatory response in individuals with small proportion of people expected to experience mild to moderate short term side effects  he told aap factcheck during phone interview  these can be as mild as having sore arm in some people  but others may feel generally unwell for day and some may feel unwell enough to see doctor  these reactions are expected but are generally very mild  dr vally said there are some people who have moderate reaction to the covid vaccination  but this is not cause for alarm based on the evidence we currently have  on the claims that the pfizer vaccine had left thousands with irreversible damage  prof petrovsky said there was no suggestion from the cdc report that any of these health events were irreversible  the vast majority  if not all  of these events are almost certainly reversible and short term  as the fda  food and drug administration  would investigate and report any significant severe events that continued much longer than expected from the trial experience  he said  cdc figures did not show that three per cent of covid    vaccine recipients in the us developed irreversible damage  rather  the december data captured       health impact events among         vaccine recipients  these events are generally short term  mild side effects that are expected after vaccination  experts said  only six cases of anaphylaxis had been

it s true that in january       health authorities warned that because of the lack of testing in pregnant populations  the use of the covid    vaccines in pregnant women was not recommended unless they were at risk of high exposure  such as healthcare workers  however  in august  due in part to new data on the safety of the vaccines and in part to surge in infections caused by the delta variant  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  urged all pregnant women to get the covid    vaccine  although the data is still incomplete  according to the cdc it suggests that the benefits of receiving covid    vaccine outweigh any known or potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy  neither the world health organization nor the cdc stated that all pregnant women should avoid covid    vaccines  editors note  since the original publication of this article  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  in august urged pregnant people to get their covid    vaccine in response to surging cases of the delta variant around the country  see further details below  in late january       the world health organization  who  recommended that pregnant women at low risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus avoid receiving their covid    immunization until further testing was conducted  observational data showed that pregnant people with covid    have an increased risk of severe illness and death compared with non pregnant people of the same reproductive age  additionally  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  noted that pregnant people with covid    may also have an increased risk of health problems during pregnancy  such as preterm birth  however  because neither the moderna nor the pfizer vaccinations had been tested in pregnant human populations  health officials warn that those who are pregnant should avoid receiving their immunization unless they are at an increased risk of exposure  in august  the cdc released new data on the safety of the vaccines in pregnant people  noting that covid    vaccination is recommended for all people    years and older  including people who are pregnant  breastfeeding  trying to get pregnant now  or might become pregnant in the future  an analysis published by the agency also found that of those included in the survey  pregnant women did not have an increased risk of miscarriage after receiving cvoid    vaccine  the vaccines are safe and effective  and it has never been more urgent to increase vaccinations as we face the highly transmissible delta variant and see severe outcomes from covid    among unvaccinated pregnant people  said cdc director dr  rochelle walensky in statement  the cdc noted that in the weeks leading up to the announcement  clinicians had seen an uptick of covid    cases in pregnant people  the increased circulation of the highly contagious delta variant  the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people  and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to covid    infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever  wrote the agency in its statement  as of this update  who had not publicly stated encouragement of covid    vaccinations in pregnant people  in june    update  the global health organization said  who recommends the use of the covid    vaccine in pregnant women when the benefits of vaccination to the pregnant woman outweigh the potential risks  to help pregnant women make this assessment  they should be provided with information about the risks of covid    in pregnancy  the likely benefits of vaccination in the local epidemiological context  and the current limitations of safety data in pregnant women  who does not recommend pregnancy testing prior to vaccination  who does not recommend delaying pregnancy or terminating pregnancy because of vaccination  in fact sheet shared by the cdc on jan     the health agency noted that limited data from animal development and reproductive toxicity studies showed that pregnant rats who received the moderna vaccination did not experience any adverse effects before or during their pregnancy  studies of the pfizer biontech were ongoing at the time  studies observing how either vaccine may impact pregnancy are planned as of this writing  and both vaccine manufacturers are monitoring participants in clinical trials who become pregnant  and because mrna vaccines do not contain the live virus  nor do they interact with persons dna  health care providers believe that they should pose little risk to pregnant people  based on how mrna vaccines work  experts believe they are unlikely to pose specific risk for people who are pregnant  previously wrote the cdc  however  the actual risks of mrna vaccines to the pregnant person and her fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant women  in its august update  the cdc noted that evidence about the safety and efficacy of covid    vaccination during pregnancy is still limited  but data suggests that the benefits of receiving the vaccine outweigh the potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]
if all the other lockdowns havent worked  why would this one be any different  false  the government estimates locking down in the spring saved thousands of lives compared with doing nothing  the reason why there are more cases is because they are testing more people  its true more people are being tested than ever before  but we also know deaths and hospitalisations have increased         deaths tested positive for coronavirus within    days of their death  so they could have died of heart attack or stroke or cancer  but it will go down as covid death  some deaths unrelated to covid    may happen within    days of positive test but this makes very little difference to the figures  up to the week ending    january         deaths were registered in england and wales with covid    recorded as the underlying cause of death by medical professional  bacterial pneumonia is caused by people wearing masks and is massively on the rise  there is no evidence that wearing mask can cause bacterial pneumonia  or that deaths from pneumonia have increased  suicides have increased during lockdown  it is too soon to know what impact the pandemic has had on the suicide rate  there is currently no evidence of dramatic increase  national child mortality database identified deaths in under   s increased dramatically in the first lockdown  this is wrong  the ncmd said there had been slight increase but the numbers were too small to draw definite conclusions  survey from samaritans said one in four people had suicidal thoughts during lockdown  survey done between march and may      found that   in    people had suicidal thoughts  children arent affected by covid    and dont transmit the virus  this is not true  children are less affected but some can still become seriously ill or die  they do transmit the virus  children wont be allowed back to school unless theyve been tested  this is incorrect  testing in schools is voluntary  up to     of pcr tests are false positives  this is wrong  it has been estimated that the false positive rate is very low  the government can introduce restrictions on universal credit where you cant get it unless you get tested and unless you get vaccine  the government has confirmed this is untrue and there are no plans to do this     million tests means that they have    millions peoples dna on file  this is wrong  no record of the patients dna is taken in the testing process and the majority of test samples are destroyed  mental health is an exemption of tier   and tier      you can go out and see friend  you can leave your house  you can leave your house during lockdown for specific reasons  regardless of mental health  for example  to meet one local friend for exercise  viral video of an influencer spreading on social media makes number of incorrect claims about the coronavirus pandemic  including its impact on children and suicide rates and misinformation about testing and face masks  theyve introduced mandatory masks  social distancing and all these measures  closed primary schools and closed secondary schools  and closed non essential shops  and yet nothing has worked  if all the other lockdowns havent worked  why would this be any different   we have written about the effectiveness of lockdowns before  explaining how the spring lockdown was responsible for the reduction in covid    deaths  detailed government estimate suggests that locking down in the spring did save many thousands of lives  compared with no lockdown or social distancing measures  largely because it prevented the health service being overwhelmed  the reason why there are more cases is because they are testing more people  the original video was posted after the announcement of the new national lockdown on   january  at which point the number of new cases in the uk was rising though it has now started to fall  there is legitimate argument that we know of more cases because of increased testing  and the uk is currently testing more people than ever before  however  when we look at the number of patients admitted to hospital with covid    and the number of deaths  there was significant increase in both since december on similar scale to deaths during the first wave Â  this shows that there has been genuine increase in the number of people with covid     not just an increase caused by more mild cases being picked up because of testing  they are saying in england there has been     million confirmed cases and        deaths  so out of those        deaths      of those were under    and no pre existing conditions      this isnt        deaths from covid  this is        deaths that had tested positive within coronavirus within    days of their death  so someone could have died of heart attack or stroke or cancer  but if they tested positive within    days then it will go down as  covid death   in england  government data shows there have been        deaths within    days of positive test  and more than     million cases as of    january  up to the week ending    january         deaths were registered in england and wales with covid    as the underlying cause of death  according to medical professional  this means these people died of covid  not heart attack or stroke or cancer  the most recent weekly nhs data  up to    january  reports     deaths of people under the age of    who had no pre existing conditions and died after positive test  however  it is important to understand what is classed as pre existing condition  this category includes people who have received treatment for mental health condition  people with learning disability or autism  and people with asthma  diabetes or dementia Â  it is misleading to suggest that all deaths of people with pre existing condition were already seriously ill Â  bacterial pneumonia  which is caused by people wearing masks  which is massively on the rise  most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and there is no evidence that masks cause it  claiming link between masks and pneumonia is not new  and it has been debunked by various different fact checkers Â  the associated press looked into this claim in june  and were told by infectious disease specialist davidson harmer that there is no evidence of masks leading to fungal or bacterial infections of the upper airway or the lower airway as in pneumonia  he said theoretically bacterial growth could occur if someone wore mask that was contaminated with moisture and became mouldy  but that was highly unlikely with normal mask use  the latest figures from the office for national statistics  ons   which cover non covid deaths recorded up to    july       found deaths from influenza and pneumonia were slightly below average levels from may onwardsdespite the wearing of face coverings first becoming mandatory on public transport in june Â  the ons said  it could be that increased social distancing has led to reduced infection rates for flu and other infectious conditions  or that some of the population susceptible to flu have died due to other causes such as covid     either way  there is no evidence of an increase in pneumonia deaths  we have the highest rate of suicide since world war two     our suicides are as high now as they were back then     male suicides are the highest for two decades and suicides in general have increased by up to       as we have written before  we do not yet fully know what impact the pandemic has had on suicides Â  the      figure may come from an article in the british medical journal which said  widely reported studies modelling the effect of the covid    pandemic on suicide rates predicted increases ranging from    to       the      figure specifically came from paper which used the increased suicide risk for prisoners in switzerland  to model the impact of lockdown Â  review of the scientific literature into suicide risk notes  prison confinement is probably not good proxy for effects of lockdown  and  regardless  this figure is based on model estimate  not actual data Â Â  the most recent figures on suicides were released by the ons in december  covering deaths registered up to september       however  there is difference between the date death is registered and the date death happened  the ons said the figures cannot show the actual number of suicides that took place in       as only     of the suicides registered up to september actually happened in      Â  all suicides are investigated by coroner  and it often takes around five to six months before death by suicide can be registered  the ons previously warned that the low number of suicides registered between april and june      likely reflects delays to inquests because of the impact of the coronavirus  covid     pandemic on the coroners service  the ons said suicide rates for both genders between july and september      were similar to rates observed in the same quarter in previous years  figures between july and september are much higher than those for the period between april and june  but the ons said this likely reflects the resuming of coroners inquests as opposed to genuine increase in suicide  these figures do not suggest suicide rates have risen by       suicides are not at their highest point since world war two  although the total number of excess deaths is  the number of deaths above the past five year average   the national child mortality database identified deaths in under   s increased dramatically in the first lockdown  the national child mortality database published report on child suicide rates during the pandemic in july  using real time surveillance  it found that in the    days before lockdown there were    likely child suicides and further    in the first    days of lockdown  it did not warn of dramatic increase  the report said  there is concerning signal that child suicide deaths may have increased during the first    days of lockdown  but risk remains low and numbers are too small to reach definitive conclusions  the samaritans did study of       adults from    to     and one in four said they had suicidal thoughts      three out of four suffered with depression  anxiety  levels of defeat or severe loneliness  so three quarters of the people that they studied suffered from mental health effects of this lockdown  survey of this size did take place  but the video has misreported the results  the university of glasgow  in partnership with the samaritans  released study in october  looking at the impact lockdown between    march and    may      had on the mental health and wellbeing of the uk public Â  this study found that thoughts of suicide increased during this period  but not as much as claimed in the video  rather than one in four adults saying they had suicidal thoughts  the results were closer to one in    Â  the study said     of participants had symptoms of moderate or severe levels of anxiety at the start of the lockdown  although this decreased as time went on      had symptoms of moderate or severe levels of depression with no real change across the first six weeks  which may be what the one in four claim was meant to refer to  feelings of defeat and entrapment decreased over time  while positive wellbeing increased  although the findings of the study were not as dramatic as claimed in the video  researchers said there was cause for concern  it warned that the mental health and wellbeing of women  young adults  the socially disadvantaged and those with pre existing mental health problems were particularly affected  it also noted that the rising rates of suicidal thoughts  especially among young adults  was particularly concerning Â  freedom of information request showed that prescriptions for sleeping pills for under   s rose by     from march      to june       this is correct  in october  the guardian reported that freedom of information figures showed prescriptions for sleeping pills for under   s rose     between march and june      compared with two years ago  children dont get affected by  covid         children arent carriers and children arent transmitting this virus  we know that children are less likely to be affected by covid    than adults are but can still get seriously ill  in september  the world health organization  who  said data suggests that children under    represent about      of reported cases  with relatively few deaths compared to other age groups and usually mild disease  however  it also warned that cases of critical illness have been reported  ons figures show that  in       the deaths ofÂ     people aged    years or younger were registered with covid    mentioned on their death certificate in england and wales  we know that children can transmit the virus  paper presented to sage in december warned that evidence suggested children were giving the virus to each other when schools were open and can transmit within households as well as in educational settings  it cited evidence that indicates children aged between    and    were playing more of role in introducing infection into households than those aged    or over  now that theyve closed all the schools  its going to be you cant go back to school until your child has been tested  its going to be weekly lateral flow testing  this is not correct  back in december  the department for education  dfe  announced that every secondary school and college in england  as well as special schools and alternative provision  would have access to weekly rapid coronavirus testing from january   although it has been paused and may now be scrapped   in blog post the dfe said the tests wouldnt be compulsory  but staff and students who experience covid    symptoms must follow government guidance if they get symptoms  an nhs testing handbook for schools confirmed testing is voluntary and pupils  or their parents or guardians  will have to give medical consent Â  up to     of false positives pcr testing  this claim could refer to two things  the idea that     of positive tests are false  because the people tested dont have the virus   or the idea that     of people who are actually negative test positive incorrectly  which is also called the false positive rate Â neither of these things are correct Â Â  to start with the false positive rate  the maximum positivity rate throughout the pandemic was during the first wave when  at one point      of all tests were positive Â even if literally all those people actually did not have the virus  which is implausible  that would mean the false positive rate could not be higher than      the false positive rate of pcr tests is not known but in general  they seem to rarely give false positives Â  the idea that     of positive tests are false may be plausible when there is very little covid    going around  for example  if the disease was completely eradicated  but one person tested positive  then the proportion of positive tests which were false would be      Â but that isnt the case now Â  in early july  only around      of tests were coming back positive  so even if  at the time  all of these positives were false  then youd expect no more than      of all tests to be false positives at any given time  the current positivity rate is around     that increase can only have been caused by an increase in the number of real infections  far less than     of positive tests are false  the claim that     of pcr tests are false positives may come from misinterpretation of statements made by various politicians in october about some research from public health england Â  this estimated that  if someone with the virus was not symptomatic when they got on flight to the uk  or they tested negative on departure  there was    chance they would test positive by the time they landed in other words  the false negative rate  not the false positive rate of pcr tests  was estimated to be      and only among this extremely specific group of people at very specific point in time  the problem is when youre then relying on the state and youre on universal credit     its very  very  very hard to get away from them  when youre relying on them for your money every single month  theyve got you  because then they can do well if youre not getting tested youre not getting your money  if you dont get the vaccine youre not getting your money  spokesperson for the department for work and pensions told full fact  these suggestions are entirely false and that there are no plans to introduce such restrictions     million tests   that means that they have    million peoples dna  the government  now has on file  the latest government figures show nearly    million tests have been carried out in the uk as of    january  when the video was made  around    million tests had been carried out  this doesnt tell us how many people have been tested  as some people are tested more than once Â  the department for health and social care  dhsc  told full fact that dna is not sequenced or used at any stage in the covid testing process  and pcr tests target genes from the virus and do not involve any kind of dna record  dhsc said the vast majority of test samples are destroyed as clinical waste  while small number of positive samples are retained to use for the development of testing techniques and processes and checking the effectiveness of new laboratories or machinery Â  mental health is an exemption of tier   and tier      so if you are suffering with your mental health or youre alone or youre single parent or

social media post claims that    people died in norway from taking pfizers covid    vaccine  the facebook post from january    reads     people die from the c  sic  pfizer vaccine in norway and according to media  they are frail  elderly  had pre existing health conditions and were probably going to die anyway  it goes on to say  there are major lockdowns  people coerced into quarantine and testing  businesses locked down  relationships destroyed and people are guilt tripped into handing over their freedoms  physical distancing and wearing face nappys  sic   how is that for absolute bs   the hypocrisy astounds me at the time of writing  the post by user from australia had been shared more than     times and generated more than    comments and     reactions  news reports on january    drew global attention to    deaths in norway among elderly people who had received the covid    pfizer biontech vaccine  however  many social media reactions to the news linked the deaths to the pfizer vaccine without providing key context  as detailed by norwegian fact checkers  faktisk  the norwegian medical agency  nma  reported that by january    there had been    suspected deaths associated with covid    vaccines reported to the norwegian adr  adverse drug reactions  registry  an nma background report said in many of the fatalities no link with vaccination is suspected and the event was due to an underlying illness suffered by the patient  it noted that only the elderly in nursing home or long term care facilities had received vaccinations to date  every day  an average of    people die in norwegian nursing homes or other similar institutions  the report added  when vaccinating such group  deaths will inevitably occur shortly after the vaccine is administered  the vast majority of those who have been vaccinated appear not to have suffered any adverse reaction to the vaccine  but the report also said that for some of the frailest patients the possibility that relatively mild side effects from the vaccine may have caused serious health consequences could not be ruled out  nma medical director steinar madsen told bloomberg in an interview on january    that connection between the vaccine and the deaths was difficult to prove  clearly  covid    is far more dangerous to most patients than vaccination  we are not alarmed  in an update to the story on january     dr madsen said  we cant say that people die from the vaccine  we can say that it may be coincidental  it is difficult to prove that its the vaccine which is the direct cause  senior physician at the norwegian institute of public health  niph   dr sara viksmoen watle  said the fatal incidents among severely frail patients do not imply causal relationship between covid    vaccination and death  in order to be able to interpret this information  it is important to see the full picture  dr watle told the niph  nursing home residents are at very high risk of severe disease course or dying from covid     and have therefore been prioritised for vaccination  large proportion of those who live in nursing homes have severe underlying conditions or are in the last stages of life  dr watle said that        people had been vaccinated against covid    in norway as of january    and the majority had mild or no side effects  so far  there are no statistical analyses that indicate that coronavirus vaccination has had an increased risk of death among those vaccinated  spokesman for pfizer told aap factcheck in an email  the norwegian medicines agency  nma  has reported while possible connection in the most vulnerable patients cannot be ruled out  they have confirmed there is no evidence of direct link between the deaths and vaccination  niph has clarified its vaccination guidance for severely frail patients  for example equivalent to clinical frailty scale   or higher  and terminally ill patients including careful assessment of the benefit versus risk of the vaccination  our immediate thoughts are with the bereaved families  aap factcheck has previously debunked claims which linked deaths among pfizer biontech vaccine trial participants to adverse effects  similar claims regarding the deaths in norway have been fact checked here  here and here  the facebook post links    deaths in norway to the pfizer vaccine without providing important context

by jessica mcdonald and catalina jaramillo posted on january            updated on august          viral video makes series of inaccurate and unfounded arguments for why people should not receive any vaccines  including those for covid     the full ingredient list for any authorized covid    vaccine can be foundÂ on the centers for disease control and preventionÂ website and in variety of documents on the food and drug administrationsÂ website  including in fact sheet for vaccine recipients thats available in numerous languages Â  both the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines contain messenger rna  or mrna  variety of fatty molecules  or lipids  to protect the mrna  and few other ingredients  including salts and sugar  to keep the vaccine stable and at similar acidity to the human body  the johnson   johnson  or janssen  vaccine contains harmless adenovirus  type of virus that typically causes the common cold  modified with the genetic material for sars cov    as well as salts as stabilizing and buffering agents  there are no preservatives  egg or latex in the vaccines  link to this theÂ authorized vaccines were initially tested in early phase clinical trials  in which scientists evaluated different doses  checked for the expected immune responses and monitored for potential safety issues  to find out whether the shots prevent disease and are safe  the vaccines that passed the first set of tests were then evaluated in phase   trials  the moderna phase   trial included about        volunteers  while the pfizer biontechÂ and johnson   johnson trials included about        each  in each of these trials  half of the participants received placebo  while the other half received the vaccine  and the volunteers were followed over time to see if they fell ill with covid    and had any adverse reactions Â Â  the trials were overseen by independent data and safety monitoring boards  and the results were reviewed not only by the food and drug administration  which made the decision to authorize the vaccines for emergency use  but also by an outside panel of experts advising the agency  another independent group  the cdcs advisory committee on immunization practices  also reviewed the data and recommended use of the vaccines  link to this as covid    cases continue to rise across the globe  anti vaccination activists try to undermine peoples confidence by spreading misinformation around the safety  efficacy and value of the covid    vaccines     minute long video posted on january    by steven baker  licensed chiropractor from idaho  on facebook and instagram gives people five reasons why they should definitely never vaccinate  the video has been liked since by       viewers on facebook and viewed by over        on instagram Â Â  baker  who describes himself as healer whos not anti vaccine but anti everything  has created business selling misinformation about vaccines  in april  facebook removed bakers ad account and page after he falsely claimed that silver spray sold on his website protected people from covid     in another video shared on tiktok and fact checked by politifact  he said people were dying because of the economic collapse caused by the pandemic  not from covid     in this video  baker adds disclaimer saying hes not giving medical advice  but he is Â  the first reason baker gives to not get vaccinated is the ingredients in the vaccines  you wouldnt give your kid shot of thimerosal  aluminum  aborted fetal tissue  chicken and eggs embryo  you wouldnt  he argues Â  but the fact is you probably already have for most of those items  and research shows the ingredients in vaccines are not harmful  also  the two u s  authorized covid    vaccines dont contain any of those ingredients Â  thimerosal is mercury containing preservative used in multi dose vaccines to help prevent potentially deadly contamination from harmful microbes  although most vaccines for children dont use it anymore  some influenza vaccines still do  thimerosal contains ethylmercury  kind of mercury thats safer than methylmercury  which can be found in certain fish and animals  ethylmercury is less toxic because it is broken down and excreted rapidly by the body  according to the u s  food and drug administration  the amount of mercury contained in vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in   ounce can of tuna fish Â  aluminum salts are present in some vaccines  they are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids  as well as in many foods and beverages  including fruit and vegetables  cereals  nuts  dairy products  flour  honey  and baby formula  the quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated  according to the childrens hospital of philadelphia  the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula  and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time Â  some vaccines are made in eggs  the influenza and yellow fever vaccines  therefore they contain egg proteins  eggs from chickens raised on farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by rooster Â  finally  baker names fetal tissue as vaccine ingredient  thats not accurate  fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early     s  one in sweden and one in england  were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines  such as varicella  chickenpox   rubella and hepatitis  but those cells arent present in the vaccines themselves  since the virus is purified before it goes into syringe  asÂ weveÂ explained  theÂ pfizer biontechÂ and theÂ modernaÂ covid    vaccinesÂ arent made from virus  according to the cdc  neither vaccine contains eggs  preservatives or latex  vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream  as baker says in the video  instead  most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin  baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines dont work because they dont prevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body  what they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus  many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms  less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths  this is huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society  it is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection  or do so fully  but thats not requirement for vaccine to be effective  vaccine  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  is product that stimulates persons immune system to produce immunity to specific disease  protecting the person from that disease  the idea is to train the immune system to recognize particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ  they will either not become infected or will not get sick  or if they do have symptoms  they will be less severe  this usually involves introducing piece of or small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body  some vaccines produce whats called sterilizing immunity  which is when antibodies glom onto pathogen and remove it before it has chance to enter cells and set up an infection  this happens  for example  with the measles  hepatitis and human papillomavirus  or hpv  vaccines  if youre given the measles vaccine  two doses  you have     chance of being protected against measles for the rest of your life  and not just disease  also asymptomatic infection  dr  paul  offit Â a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the childrens hospital of philadelphia  told us  referring to when someone is infected but doesnt have symptoms  youre done with that virus  many other vaccines  offit said  including seasonal influenza  rotavirus  whooping cough and pneumococcal vaccines  keep people from becoming seriously ill but arent able to prevent infection  thats okay  he said  because the main goal youre trying to do in these cases is prevent children or adults from being hospitalized or killed  importantly  many vaccines can still reduce the spread of disease even if they dont stop infection  contrary to bakers other claim that vaccines  including covid    vaccines  dont prevent transmission  that can happen  offit said  because vaccinated person often sheds less virus  making them less contagious  its not known yet whether the authorized covid    vaccines prevent transmission of the sars cov   virus  but its likely the same dynamic will be at play and the vaccines will limit transmission to some degree Â  until more is known  its important that people who receive covid    vaccine dont assume they cant pass the virus on to others  and continue to wear masks and physically distance  but its also premature for baker to declare the vaccines to be useless in preventing the spread of sars cov    as part of bakers specious argument that vaccines dont work  he brings up the example of polio and falsely says the disease subsided because of sanitation  not vaccination  obviously  polio went away because of sanitation because its fecal oral disease  baker says  and if you start washing your hands and not drinking water in the streets  youre probably not going to get polio  while better sanitation helps reduce the spread of poliovirus  which is passed along primarily through feces but can also be spread through infectious droplets from sneezes or coughs  it is vaccination that is credited with eliminating the virus in the u s Â  after all  sanitation was quite good in     s america  but polio was still major threat to families every summer  perhaps counterintuitively  improved sanitation is thought to be why there was surge in polio cases in the u s  in the beginning of the early   th century  before       polio was silently circulating  explained micaela martinez  an infectious disease ecologist at columbia university who has studied the history of the disease  the virus was rampant  she said  but because virtually everyone would become infected as an infant when there is low risk of getting severe disease and developing paralysis  it wasnt particularly noticed  as sanitation improved  however  children wouldnt encounter the virus until they were older  when the risk of paralysis was greater  so sanitation actually led to this first emergence of polio as being widespread paralytic disease  martinez told us  polio epidemics became even worse after world war ii with the baby boom  as more children were around to further spread the disease  she added  it wasnt until vaccines arrived that cases began to fall  from more than        paralysis cases every year  according to the cdc  to fewer than     annually in the     s and fewer than    each year in the following decade  the disease was eliminated in the u s  in       meaning there is no ongoing transmission of polio in the country  and no cases have originated in the u s  since that time  polio vaccination is still important  however  as the disease could be introduced at any time by travelers  baker proceeds to incorrectly say that there is no such thing as safe trial with vaccines  because no vaccines are tested against what he considers true placebos  this is categorically false  what they do is they actually compare the vaccine that theyre testing to different vaccine  or they will compare the vaccine theyre testing to syringe that is full of aluminum and everything in the vaccine  except for the antigen  he says  referring to the part of the vaccine that will trigger the specific immune response  in fact  many vaccines have been tested against saline  or saltwater  placebo in randomized controlled trials  including influenza and certain mumps  polio and measles vaccines  but there are also good reasons to use different placebo controls in trials  and it does not mean vaccine has not been fully vetted for safety  for example  as outlined by world health organization expert panel  if safe and effective vaccine against specific disease already exists  then the real question becomes whether the new vaccine performs similarly or better  and in many cases it would be unethical to deprive group of people of protective vaccine  it is also argued  offit said  that its not fair to enroll participants in vaccine trial and not give them something of benefit  which sometimes means giving different vaccine as control  another potential reason for deviating from saline placebo is preserving the blinding of trial  making sure volunteers in trials dont know whether they have been randomly assigned to the control group  since many vaccines do have some minor  temporary side effects  such as arm soreness  that can clue participants into which shot they received  baker gets his facts wrong once again when says the moderna covid    vaccine was tested against meningitis vaccine  both the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines  which are the only two covid    vaccines currently authorized for use in the u s   were tested against saline placebo Â  some arms of the oxford astrazeneca covid    vaccine trial did include meningococcal vaccine as control to reduce the chance that control volunteers would know they didnt get the covid    vaccine  thats true of the u k  portion of the trial and part of the brazilian trial  which used the meningococcal group  c  w and y conjugate vaccine as control for the first dose  but not the second Â  saline  however  was used for the south african arm of the trial and the        person trial in the u s   which is still ongoing  baker also argues people should not get vaccinated because vaccines are not safe and companies are not liable  you cannot sue them  but yet they have special court  and that special court to date has paid out over    billion in damages  he says  baker is referring to the national vaccines injury compensation program  created by the national childhood vaccine injury act of       vaccines are extensively tested to ensure theyre effective and safe  but just like any other medication  theyre not risk free and can cause adverse events or side effects  most vaccines can cause pain  redness or tenderness where they were injected  and some can cause more severe events  beginning in the mid     s  several lawsuits were filed against vaccine makers and health care providers  which led manufacturers to stop their production  they were forced to pay for damages despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting injury claims  the threats of vaccine shortage moved congress to pass the national childhood vaccine injury act  which creates compensation fund  according to theÂ latest data  the government has paid out nearly      billion in compensation since       but as we have previously explained  the fact that there have been payouts doesnt mean that vaccines caused an injury  according to the health resources and services administration  approximately     of all compensation awarded by the fund is result of negotiated settlement between the parties  previous to any review of the evidence  to save time and money Â  still  the number of complaints and compensations is very low  over     billion doses of covered vaccines were distributed in the u s  from      to       according to the cdc  in that same period of time  only       petitions were adjudicated and of those       were compensated  the world health organization estimates thatÂ immunizations prevent   to   million deaths every year globally Â in the u s   the cdc estimates flu vaccines averted         hospitalizations and       deaths in the           season  according to preliminary data   the national childhood vaccine injury act also requires health care providers to report side effects occurring after immunization to the vaccines adverse event reporting system  program created in      and co administrated by the cdc and the fda  the act also allows individuals to pursue legal action against vaccine manufacturer under certain conditions  including negligence on the part of the vaccine maker Â  in the video  baker falsely claims that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children and cites study published in november      in international journal of environmental research and public health  an open access

conduct has breached the standard of care and has placed the health and safety of many of his patients at serious risk of harm  one of his unvaccinated patients developed severe case of tetanus that required two month stay in an intensive care unit Â  in the video  baker baselessly accuses the cdc of profiting off vaccines and falsely states that dr  thomas license was removed because of the truth revealed in his study  the cdc is not in the business to make you safe or help you and your kids  the cdc is in the business of marketing vaccines and profiting off of you and your family getting vaccinated  period  he argues Â Â  vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity and prevents potential life threatening diseases  according to the cdc  all vaccines  including covid    vaccines  meet rigorous safety criteria set by the fda  the fact of the matter is  not shockingly  people who are vaccinated are healthier because theyre not likely to catch bacterial and viral infections  offit said  theres not year that goes by at childrens hospital of philadelphia where we do not see child suffer and die from vaccine preventable disease because the parent chose not to vaccinate them  the top reason to avoid all vaccinations  baker baselessly says  is that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases  he even goes so far as to say that covid    vaccines will create millions and millions of people with an autoimmune disease  there is no evidence for that  baker betrays his lack of knowledge on the subject by claiming this happens because with vaccines you are bypassing natural defenses instead of having true actual immune response and by likening vaccination to getting an organ transplant in which you need drugs to suppress the immune system  but vaccination is nothing like an organ transplant  and vaccines only temporarily activate the immune system  doing so in safer way than natural infection  since vaccines dont drive the immune response nearly as vigorously as natural infections do  it is less likely that they would induce autoimmunity  explains the childrens hospital of philadelphias website  scientists have looked into whether

study after study after study shows that vaccines dont induce autoimmunity and it doesnt make sense they would induce autoimmunity  people should believe them  one autoimmune disorder  guillain barrÃ© syndrome  has been linked to influenza vaccination  but inconsistently so  and at very low frequencies  around   to   in   million doses  most people who develop the condition fully recover  although some people are left with permanent nerve damage and some people die  cases of the disease also follow infections  and research shows that the risk of developing guillain barrÃ© from flu is much higher than after immunization with flu shot  in another rare instance  pandemic flu vaccine in europe in           may have provoked some people with genetic predisposition to develop an autoimmune reaction that led to narcolepsy  but in that case as well  its not entirely clear what role the vaccine played  and its possible natural infection with influenza poses similar or higher risk  while scientists continue to monitor for any sign that immunizations might lead to autoimmunity  there is no basis for bakers claim that vaccines  including those for covid     are dangerous because they

posing in front of camera while pretending to take vaccination shot   many people are sharing the video claiming that these two government officials have not taken the vaccination but are just pretending in front of the camera   facebook group  bangalore      shared the video with the caption   video of dho dr nagendrappa and dr rajani in tumakuru   karnataka just mocking the taking of jab

coronavirus  vaccine  india    vinod chand rajiv tyagi  wtf is happening here  jumlepejumla pic twitter com gp yljxsbv website  daijiworld com reported that dho nagendrappa and government nursing college principal rajani pretended to take the vaccine  digital media platform oneindia com also reported about the incident claiming dho and principal only pretended to take the coronavirus vaccine  both are being severely criticised on social media    the dho of tumkur and principal of government nursing college pretended to take coronavirus vaccine and have not taken the vaccine in real  the logical indian spoke to the district health officer of tumkur  mb nagendrappa  who confirmed that both principal rajini and him took the vaccination on january           he said   we both took the vaccination on the very first day of the coronavirus vaccination drive to encourage the frontline workers to take the coronavirus vaccine  since vaccination was being given in separate room and not in public  so the media reporters insisted us to pose for pictures with the vaccine shot  we did as told by them and some miscreant took that video and shared on social media with fake claim that they did not take the jab    nagendrappa also told us that his department knows about this incident and he has also sent clarification to the information officer in this regard  he also told us that as he is going to take legal action against those who are defaming him  he was very saddened at the turn of events and said he has documents which prove that he and principal rajini have taken the vaccination  he was representing himself to his senior on the issue when we called him   principal rajani gave an interview to local journalist and in the interview she said   i am being trolled on social media and i want to clarify that i took vaccine on january    itself  my name was registered on the portal  my office was vaccination site so i was doing arrangements for receiving doctors  after taking the vaccine  when i was getting up then some media people visited the vaccination room and asked for photos  so i again sat   she said that while she was giving pose  some miscreants clicked the photo and shared it on social media    hence  the viral video was taken when they were asked to just pose for the media and they have taken the vaccination   if you have any news that you

take action on  the amount of mercury contained in vaccine is roughly the same amount contained in   ounce can of tuna fish Â  aluminum salts are present in some vaccines  they are also found in some health products such as buffered aspirin and antacids  as well as in many foods and beverages  including fruit and vegetables  cereals  nuts  dairy products  flour  honey  and baby formula  the quantities of aluminum contained in vaccines are low and regulated  according to the childrens hospital of philadelphia  the amount of aluminum infants receive in their first six months of life from vaccines is about eight times lower than what they receive from formula  and about half of what they receive from breast milk in that same amount of time Â  some vaccines are made in eggs  the influenza and yellow fever vaccines  therefore they contain egg proteins  eggs from chickens raised on farm are technically chicken embryos if fertilized by rooster Â  finally  baker names fetal tissue as vaccine ingredient  thats not accurate  fetal cells obtained from two aborted pregnancies in the early     s  one in sweden and one in england  were made into cell lines that are used to grow virus to make some vaccines  such as varicella  chickenpox   rubella and hepatitis  but those cells arent present in the vaccines themselves  since the virus is purified before it goes into syringe  asÂ weveÂ explained  theÂ pfizer biontechÂ and theÂ modernaÂ covid    vaccinesÂ arent made from virus  according to the cdc  neither vaccine contains eggs  preservatives or latex  vaccines do not go directly into the bloodstream  as baker says in the video  instead  most vaccines are injected into muscle or skin  baker goes on to incorrectly say that vaccines dont work because they dont prevent the virus or bacteria from getting in your body  what they do is that they reduce the amount of symptoms that you have from that bacteria or virus  many vaccines are in fact helpful precisely because they reduce symptoms  less severe disease means less suffering and fewer deaths  this is huge part of why vaccines have been so beneficial to society  it is true that not all vaccines can prevent infection  or do so fully  but thats not requirement for vaccine to be effective  vaccine  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  is product that stimulates persons immune system to produce immunity to specific disease  protecting the person from that disease  the idea is to train the immune system to recognize particular pathogen so that if someone does encounter the germ  they will either not become infected or will not get sick  or if they do have symptoms  they will be less severe  this usually involves introducing piece of or small amount of weakened or killed virus or bacteria into the body  some vaccines produce whats called sterilizing immunity  which is when antibodies glom onto pathogen and remove it before it has chance to enter cells and set up an infection  this happens  for example  with the measles  hepatitis and human papillomavirus  or hpv  vaccines  if youre given the measles vaccine  two doses  you have     chance of

it is approaching year since the world health organization declared covid    pandemic Â and on dec     britain was the first western country to begin vaccination against the virus  the rollout was

instagram user borzirtc  other social media users have posted the same or similar claim  as recently as jan      usa today has reached out to those who posted the claim for further comment Â Â  more  fact check  covid    outbreak at ny nursing home started before vaccinations operation warp speed  the private public partnership initiated by the white house during the pandemic  may give the impression the covid    vaccine developed overnight  but in actuality  it depends on research datingÂ back nearly     years Â  coronaviruses were first encountered in april       when strange respiratory disease ravagedÂ poultry farms across north dakota and minnesota  killing tens of thousands of baby birds  the scientist reports  unsure of what exactly this illness was  veterinarians arthur schalk and merle hawn of north dakota agricultural college  now north dakota state university  called it  infectious bronchitis of baby chicks   the viral agent later named infectious bronchitis virus  further scientific research into ibv and recognition that it was not like influenza  flu virus known to causeÂ bronchitis  would transpire over the next    years  in november       group of scientists wrote to the journal nature asking for ibv  and viruses resembling it like mouse hepatitis virus discovered in       to be classified as coronaviruses  name derived from its appearance  the spikeÂ proteins castingÂ a halo around the surface  much like the sun s corona  on electron microscopeÂ imaging  more  fact check  pregnant women do receive vaccines  but more study needed on covid    shot while coronaviruses could cause variety of fatal diseases in animals  the two known to infect humans were not grave concern  as they only causedÂ the common cold  this belief was challenged in november      with the emergence of new respiratory illness in guandong province  china  that would infect over       people worldwide and claim     lives  in less than month  researchers decoded the enormous genome of the new virus  which caused aÂ disease called severe acute respiratory syndrome Â researchers concluded it was coronavirus  likely to have jumped from animals to humans because it was only somewhat related to other known coronaviruses   it took over    years of search to identify bats as the potential animal source  Â by july       thanks to isolating and quarantining patients  the world health organization declared sars officially contained  nevertheless  fears of future seasonal sars outbreaks called for vaccine  sars cov s spike protein was an obvious choice for target Â prior research found the spike protein was criticalÂ in determining which species coronavirus infected  where it preferredÂ to hunker down  called organ or cell tropism  and disease severity  the spike protein had even been proposed as vaccine target for canine coronavirus in       more  fact check  vaccination helped eradicate smallpox number of vaccines targeting the spikeÂ protein were designed  tested in animal models and found to be quite promising against sars and other coronavirus illnesses like middle east respiratory syndrome Â which appeared in       but further testing reached an impasse when funding declined steadily in the years following the      outbreak  said dr  peter hotez Â a vaccine scientist and dean of the national school of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine in houston  whose team collaborated withÂ galveston national laboratory to create sars vaccineÂ in        we manufactured really great sars   vaccine in the lab  we actually had manufacturer at walter reed  but then we couldn t raise the money to do all the clinical testing   he told usa today  funding was not the only issue  testing whether vaccine can prevent disease requires the disease to still be around  since there have been no major outbreaks of sars since       testing vaccine efficacy was difficult  but more instrumental is interest  fewÂ sars or mers cases meant pharmaceutical companies were less inclined to invest in likely rarely used vaccine  more  fact check  doctors say hilary duff likely didn t contract pink eye from covid    tests typically  the road to creating new vaccines is long  with many steps Â finding and developing vaccine target  exploratory   testing it in tissue or cell cultures and animal models  preclinical  followed by three phases of clinical trials with human volunteers  if vaccine proves its mettle  its developers have to seek and gain approval from the fda before manufacturing  lastly Â in phase four  quality control monitorsÂ for any possible vaccine side effects Â Â  for vaccines to be effective  specific targetÂ is needed  this vaccine target  also called an antigen  isÂ typically fragment of the disease causing agentÂ that instructs the immune system on how to recognize and destroy it upon contact  searching for suitable antigen can be an arduous process but prior coronavirus research made it all easier Â Â  Â Â   when the chinese put up the covid    sequence on biorxiv in january  our community of scientists looked at it and said   yeah  we got this because we know how to do it   it was all about plug and play based on all thatÂ experience   said hotez  having running start does not mean the testing process was accelerated  however  hotez  whose recombinant proteinÂ subunit covid    vaccine is undergoing clinical trials in india  stated the vaccine still underwent testing among large group of human volunteers  even more than typical trial with over        to        people Â  what accelerated the vaccine process was manufacturing Â Â Â   the two accelerants are doing the manufacturing of risk  scaling up manufacturing based on the assumption the vaccine will work  also called at risk manufacturing  and manufacturing the vaccine in parallel with clinical trials  that s new because we usually wait for the phase three results   he said  more  fact check  the us saw more deaths in      than in       driven by the covid    pandemic human immunodeficiency virus  the culprit behind acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  commonlyÂ known asÂ aids Â is tricky virus  much like the novel coronavirus  hiv binds to protein on the surface of t cells Â a type of white blood cell  to enter Â once inside  hiv integrates its genetic material with its host cell s dna  using the host s dna replication machinery to create new viruses  which blast off to infect and kill other t cells  finding specific and effective vaccine target is therefore difficult  especially since hiv mutates frequently in order to mask itself from the immune system  according to the national institute of allergy and infectious disease  common vaccine approaches using inactivated or live hiv formsÂ have either not been  effective in eliciting immune responses in clinical trials  or are too dangerous to use  the same goes for the common cold Â which is caused by aÂ smorgasbord of viruses includingÂ over     different types of rhinovirus  common troublemaker Â   it s hard to create vaccine when you have so many different viruses causing similar symptoms  to make universal vaccine against all of them is probably pretty daunting  it might be doable  but it s daunting   explained hotez  more  fact check  biden said he plans to increase covid    small business relief to people of color and women cancer  abnormal growth of the body s own cells due to unchecked genetic mutations  is no virus  but the struggle in finding suitable vaccine target is not any easier Â   the challenge is getting antigen targets and also access because lot of the antigens  or cancer proteins  are first inside the cell  they may not be presented to the immune system so these are much more complicated targets   said hotez Â  advancesÂ in messenger rna based vaccine technology in recent years may help fast trackÂ some cancer vaccines  he acknowledged  the platform  which provides the body the equivalent of genetic assembly instruction booklet for manufacturing target specific antibodies  has been used for rabies  influenza and zika and is considered an attractive approach for its low cost  speed of manufacturing  potency and versatility  nature reported  many cancer vaccines using mrna are in the works  like moderna s personalized cancer vaccine  mrna       which is being tested in patients with metastatic common epithelial cancer  the boston based pharmaceutical company also announced on jan     it was working on an mrna hiv vaccine with phase i clinical trials expected sometime in       we rate this claim missing contextÂ because without additional context it might be misleading  vaccines require specific targets against which they train the immune system  covid    s spike protein was identified nearly    years ago as potential vaccine target during the development of the sars vaccine  following the      sars outbreak Â this has helped expedite the vaccine process  given that vaccine platform technologiesÂ have advanced in recent years  as well  another accelerant was the commercial scale production of covid    vaccine doses prior to fda clearance  called at risk manufacturing  when early results appeared promising  finding suitable vaccine targets for hiv  cancer and the common cold has been more difficult in comparison as these diseases have either elusive or highly variable targets,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

in the video are tumakuru district health officer  dho  nagendrappa and principal of district health coaching centre dr rajani m  the officials posed on request from the media  the tumakaru district magistrate confirmed that they were later vaccinated on the same day  the archived versions of similar posts can be seen here  here  and here  afwa probe with the help of keyword search  we found news report published on january    on the website of deccan heralds kannada daily prajavani  the report carried picture of the same man seen in the video taking jab  the picture caption in kannada translates to  dho nagendrappa getting vaccinated at tumkur district hospital  we then reached out to rakesh kumar  the district magistrate of tumakuru district  rubbishing the viral claim  kumar said  the officials you see in the video did take the vaccine  the vaccination process that day was delayed due to technical reasons  for instance  the co win application was not automatically allotting the sessions to registered candidates and officials had to do it manually  but the media could not wait till the official vaccination process began  thats why the officials posed in that way  later  all of them were vaccinated  we have also submitted report on the matter to authorities concerned  channabasappa k  the additional deputy commissioner as well as additional district magistrate of tumakuru  also confirmed that the viral claim is misleading  the claim that the district health officials faked the vaccination is not true  when i conducted an inquiry  it was revealed that due to technical issues with the co win application  the vaccination process was delayed  however  since the media was in hurry to leave  the officials posed for few clicks  they were later vaccinated on the same day  channabasappa confirmed  we also spoke to tumakuru dho nagendrappa  the man seen in the viral video  speaking to afwa  nagendrappa said  according to the co win application  our date of taking the first shot was not january     however  we were later informed to pre pone the date to january     the first day of the vaccination drive  so  we had to re register and the process got delayed  however  the media was in hurry to leave after covering our vaccination  so  we finally decided to pose for some pictures  afwa also received clarification note by dr rajani m  principal of the district health coaching centre and the woman seen in the viral video  the note with her letterhead was written to the district information officer confirming that she took the covishield shot on january     dr rajani also submitted copy of her jab certificate  in this  it can be seen that she took the covishield vaccine on january           from the tumakuru district hospital  afwa then spoke to rangaraju  reporter of kannada daily vartha bharati who was present at the tumakuru district hospital on january     i was among the media personnel in the same room at tumakuru district hospital where the video in question was shot  the media had no time to wait till the official process started  we asked the officials to pose for us so we could leave at the earliest  unfortunately  someone shot the video and that went viral with misleading claims  rangaraju said  india today stringer at tumakuru  devaprakash  was also present at the hospital at that time  he too confirmed that the officials posed on request from the media and they later got vaccinated  hence  it is clear that the viral video only shows the district officials posing for the media ahead of the official

video shared on social media claims the australian government allocated around      million for the university of queenslands potential coronavirus vaccine despite the university failing to meet peer review benchmark for the funding  the video on the facebook page of riccardo bosi  former army lieutenant colonel and political aspirant  features an excerpt from an episode of his youtube talk show with joel jammal in which they both discuss australias covid    vaccine plan  mr bosi claims that australian prime minister scott morrison put     odd million dollars into vaccine that scored three out of seven out of queensland  video mark   sec   he goes on say that research candidates need to score four out of seven out of peer reviews and have produced vaccine before you get that level of funding  mr bosi goes on to claim  we know that the  pcr  test doesnt test for covid  the designer of the test  the cpr  crp  sic   we know the test is bogus and yet this imbecile and his mates in the states are rolling it out  the test is meaningless   video mark  min    sec   at the time of writing  the january    post had been viewed more than         times and shared over      times  attracting more than       reactions and       comments  the australian government invested only tiny fraction of the claimed      million in the university of queenslands unsuccessful covid    vaccine candidate  which it says met all requirements for the allocated funding  australia is due to roll out covid    immunisations in mid late february with priority given to health  border control and aged care workers  before announcing the plan  the government entered into four vaccine supply agreements  with pfizer biontech  university of oxford astrazeneca  novavax and gavis covax facility  it also granted    million in financial support for vaccine candidate developed by uq  however clinical trials did not proceed to phase three after several phase one trial participants returned false positive hiv test results  the queensland government also allocated     million to the uq vaccine program on top of the federal government funding  federal department of health spokeswoman confirmed to aap factcheck in an email that uq vaccine applications were awarded research grants of    million  in             million was allocated through the medical research future fund for research supporting the development of the university of queensland vaccine  the department spokeswoman said  according to the governments grants portal  the uq vaccine program received    million grant in april      and near    million grant in june       the uq candidate was developed in partnership with australian biotech company csl  which would manufacture the product if it was successful  csl announced the agreement in press release  and confirmed the federal governments    million funding  regarding to the claim of peer study benchmarks for funding  spokeswoman for the national health and medical research council  nhmrc   the australian body which funds medical research  told aap factcheck in an email that it seven point scale was used to assess grant opportunities  and applications are considered for funding in rank order based on those scores  whether the grant opportunity sets minimum score that must be achieved depends on the objectives of the program  if minimum score must be met  it is specified in the published grant guidelines for each grant opportunity  she said  uq was awarded funding of    million for covid    vaccine development through two medical research future fund grant opportunities  with one using the seven point rating scale and the other using three point rating scale  uq spokeswoman told aap factcheck in an email the university had not been advised of any scoring or ranking information as part of its vaccine grants  the department of health spokeswoman said the outcomes of evaluations made by grant assessment committees were confidential  however  the university of queenslands applications for funding met the requirements of the grant opportunity guidelines  any applications that failed to meet these requirements of the  guidelines  would be ineligible for funding under that grant opportunity  the spokeswoman said  before uq clinical trials were halted in december  the government had announced an investment of      billion to pre order      million doses of uq and astrazeneca vaccines  department of health spokeswoman told aap factcheck that details on the uq deal was commercial in confidence  however media reports said the agreement was worth    billion for    million doses  the uq purchase did not proceed as the planned vaccine trials were aborted  aap factcheck sent number of questions to mr bosi regarding his claims but received no response  the suggestion the inventor of pcr tests said they were ineffective at detecting covid    has previously been debunked  as has misinformation about false positives rendering testing results meaningless and tests not being able to distinguish between covid    and the flu or common cold  dr ian mackay  virologist from the university of queensland previously told aap factcheck pcr tests used to detect covid    infections in people were extremely effective at very sensitively and specifically detecting sars cov    the leading tests have also been tested on sars cov   rna from infected patients  isolated and grown in cells in the lab  so we know it is this virus that were detecting  he said  aap factcheck previously debunked claims in another video on mr bosis facebook page that the prime minister helped president elect joe biden violate the logan act  the university of queensland has not received around      million for its covid    vaccine research  both the university and government told aap factcheck the program received only    million in federal funding  figure backed up by published grant information  there is no evidence that the vaccine program failed to meet grant guidelines as claimed  while the video also shares debunked statements about the effectiveness of pcr tests in detecting covid     false  content that has no basis in fact,[1. 0.

review   facebook posts purporting to look at facts about the covid    vaccines called into question the purpose of the vaccines  see example   based on one version  the text may have originated from telegram group named corona investigative  see screenshot   this group itself published blog containing numerous false claims about the covid    pandemic  such as the claim that theres no proof that the virus causing covid    exists  theres plenty of evidence it exists  and the claim that germ theory is myth  it isnt   several of the answers to the questions about the covid    vaccines are oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy  this review explains why this list of questions and answers can be misleading for readers  several of the questions  such as the ones asking whether vaccinated person can stop mask wearing  physical  social  distancing  handwashing  and whether vaccinated person is still contagious  are answered with no  but the post failed to explain why  leaving readers with the false impression that the vaccines have no role in return to normal life  these questions are intrinsically tied to the question of whether the vaccines will stop covid    transmission  the reason why vaccinated people need to continue practicing preventative measures to reduce the spread of covid     such as mask wearing and physical distancing  isnt because the vaccines are ineffective  we know from clinical trial data that the vaccines authorized for emergency use by the u s  food and drug administration  fda  have high level of efficacy in protecting vaccinated people from becoming sick  both the pfizer biontech and moderna vaccines showed more than     efficacy  while the johnson   johnson vaccine showed an efficacy of     against moderate to severe illness and     efficacy against severe disease  however  the vaccines ability to reduce transmission hasnt been established conclusively yet  therefore  significant concern is that vaccinated people can transmit the virus to unvaccinated people  this  combined with the fact that not everyone can be vaccinated at the same time  due to issues like the scarcity of vaccine supplies and labor shortage  means that unvaccinated people will remain the majority of the population in most countries for some weeks to months  to protect this majority  vaccinated people still need to continue following public health recommendations for the time being  but this isnt permanent state of affairs  as epidemiologist and assistant professor at the university of texas health center katelyn jetelina  explained in her facebook post  when enough people are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity  normal activities  such as going to restaurants  cinemas  and meeting loved ones  can be resumed safely  therefore  vaccines are critical to safe reopenings  even vaccine that prevents covid    but not transmission is better than no vaccine  covid    vaccine that prevents disease will reduce the number of cases that require medical attention  thereby alleviating the burden on the healthcare system  it also decreases the number of deaths and complications arising from severe covid    cases  sarah caddy  clinical research fellow in viral immunology at the university of cambridge  illustrated the usefulness of such vaccine in this article published by the conversation  some vaccines stop you getting symptomatic disease  but others stop you getting infected too  the latter is known as sterilising immunity  with sterilising immunity  the virus cant even gain toehold in the body because the immune system stops the virus entering cells and replicating     in an ideal world  all vaccines would induce sterilising immunity  in reality  it is actually extremely difficult to produce vaccines that stop virus infection altogether  most vaccines that are in routine use today do not achieve this  for example  vaccines targeting rotavirus  common cause of diarrhoea in infants  are only capable of preventing severe disease  but this has still proven invaluable in controlling the virus  in the us  there has been almost     fewer cases of rotavirus associated hospital visits since the vaccine was introduced in       similar situation occurs with the current poliovirus vaccines  yet there is hope this virus could be eradicated globally  in this nature article  florian krammer  professor of vaccinology at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai  stated right now  we need vaccine that works  even if the vaccine only works for few months or doesnt stop transmission  thats what we need in order to get half way back to normal  that being said  scientists think it is likely the covid    vaccines also reduce transmission to some degree  in this quartz article  matthew woodruff  an immunologist at emory university  said  i cant imagine how the vaccine would prevent symptomatic infection at the efficacies that  companies  reported and have no impact on transmission  akiko iwasaki  an immunologist and professor at yale school of medicine  told the new york times  my feeling is that once you develop some form of immunity with the vaccine  your ability to get infected will also go down    even if youre infected  the level of virus that you replicate in your nose should be reduced  samuel scarpino  director of the emergent epidemics lab and assistant professor at northeastern university  told wired  we dont have any reason to think the pfizer and moderna vaccines wont block transmission  its just not what has actually been measured  and something we arent likely to find out until we either start mass vaccination and or they release more detailed information on the study locationsand epidemiologists start looking for effects of herd immunity  as john moore  virologist and professor at weill cornell medicine  said to the new york times  the more you reduce viral load  the less likely you are to be transmissible  but he added that all of these are things where data trumps theory  and we need the data  the text also questioned why people should take the vaccines since it doesnt provide      protection for the vaccinated person and for others  and because the survival rate for covid    is high  the premise is misleading  firstly  it dismisses the vaccines because they dont work perfectly  this is known as the nirvana fallacy  where solution to problem is rejected because it is imperfect  even though perfect solution is unrealistic  secondly  it assumes that the only concern about covid    is death and that those who dont die recover completely  no vaccine exists that provides      protection from disease  but the ones that are available now provide significant improvement to the current situation compared to time when no covid    vaccine was available  by preventing the risk of illness  the vaccines help to reduce the likelihood that an individual develops severe covid     reduce the mortality from the disease  and reduce the burden placed on healthcare systems and prevent overloading  while most people who develop covid    do survive  there is certain proportion of survivors who develop long term effects from covid     this condition has been termed long covid  among some of the effects are shortness of breath  fatigue  and an inability to focus or think clearly  brain fog   these can considerably affect persons quality of life  long covid is unpredictable in several ways  as stephanie lavergne  an infectious disease researcher at colorado state university  wrote in piece for the conversation  it isnt clear how long it will take for the effects to go away  also  long covid doesnt only affect people whove had serious covid     people who had mild cases  as well as young and athletic people  have also developed long covid  the text also claimed that the vaccines could kill some people  which is unsupported by the safety data from clinical trials and safety signals from ongoing vaccination campaigns  which dont show an increased risk of death among vaccinated individuals as compared to unvaccinated individuals  as explained in previous health feedback reviews here and here  more than    million people have received the covid    vaccination in the u s  to date  common side effects of the covid    vaccines include fever  headache  and pain at the injection site  so far  the only serious side effect known to be caused by the vaccines is severe allergic reaction  anaphylaxis   clinical trial data and safety monitoring of current covid    vaccination campaigns demonstrate that the vaccines authorized for emergency use in the u s  are safe and effective  and contrary to the message given by the facebook post  vaccines will be critical for restoring normalcy to our lives  once enough people have been vaccinated and herd immunity is established  activities such as going to restaurants  pubs  and cinemas  as well as in person meetings  will be safe to resume  it will also eventually be safe to stop physical distancing and mask wearing  while these activities are currently discouraged even though the vaccines are now available  this isnt evidence that the vaccines arent working  rather  precautions are still in place because not everyone can be vaccinated at once  vaccine supplies are scarce  and for the moment  unvaccinated  and unprotected  people are still the majority  for this reason  vaccinated people need to continue to practice physical distancing and mask wearing for the time being  on the subject of covid    vaccines  angela rasmussen  virologist and affiliate at the georgetown center for global health science and security  concluded in new york times opinion piece  we would do well to remind ourselves of the transformative power of vaccines that prevent disease without completely preventing infection when enough people take the vaccine  the sooner we reduce spread in the community and protect as many people as possible through vaccination  the sooner

florida physician gregory michael died on jan              days after receiving the first dose of pfizers covid    vaccine  the death  described by michaels wife in facebook post and later reported by usa today and the new york times  among others  was the result of acute immune  or idiopathic  thrombocytopenia  itp   disease in which the bodys immune system turns against the platelets in blood that allow it to clot  other drugs and vaccines have been known to cause  in extremely rare cases  this same condition  and there is legitimate scientific debate over the possibility that the covid vaccine precipitated this immune response  several case reports suggest that covid    itself can cause this condition as well  in statement  pfizer said it does not believe the death was directly caused by the vaccine  as reported by the times  pfizer  the maker of the vaccine  said it was actively investigating the case  but we dont believe at this time that there is any direct connection to the vaccine  there have been no related safety signals identified in our clinical trials  the post marketing experience thus far  or with the technology used to make the vaccine  the company said  our immediate thoughts are with the bereaved family  the u s  centers for disease control and prevention is also investigating the incident and will provide timely updates on what is known and any necessary actions  it said in statement  based on the current information available  there are range of qualified opinions on the possible link between the vaccine and this death  but even those most convinced of link say it should not be cause to limit or avoid vaccination  jerry spivak  an expert on blood disorders at johns hopkins university uninvolved in the micheal case  told the times that  i think it is medical certainty that the vaccine was related  but that this sort of outcome is going to be very rare and should not stop people from being vaccinated  david gorski  physician who writes the blog science based medicine  explained that even if causal association exists between the vaccine and itp  data from pfizers phase   trial indicate it would still be safer to get the vaccine than it would be to take the risk of catching covid     what if there really is an association between the pfizer biontech covid vaccine and itp  even in the case that there is such an association  we know that  for the phase   clinical trial to have missed it  the incidence of post covid vaccination itp must be very  very low  that would imply that  even if there is such an association  it is far safer to get the vaccine than it is to take the risk of catching covid     and  again  this is just one story  we do not know if dr  michaels case  as tragic as it is  even indicates potential causation  paul offit  the director of the vaccine education center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at childrens hospital of philadelphia  told the times that  well keep our eyes open and see if it happens to anybody else  right now were guessing  its an association in time  but not necessarily causal association  because evidence of causal relationship is lacking  the claim remains unproven,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
the claims made in the message are false or manipulated  and the vaccine will help in curbing the pandemic  message viral on the internet is trying to discourage people from taking the coronavirus vaccine by claiming that the covid    vaccine does not help the recipient in any way  however  we found that the claims made in the viral message are manipulated and false and research shows that vaccines will help in curbing the pandemic  claim the long message has been shared on facebook  twitter and also on whatsapp  the full message reads  if i get vaccinated      can i stop wearing the mask   no    can they reopen restaurants etc and everyone work normally   no    will i be resistant to covid   maybe  but we don t know exactly  it probably won t stop you getting it    at least i won t be contagious to others anymore   no you can still pass it on  possibly  nobody knows     if we vaccinate all children  will school resume normally   no    if i am vaccinated  can i stop social distancing   no    if i am vaccinated  can i stop disinfecting my hands   no    if i vaccinate myself and my grandfather  can we hug each other   no    will cinemas  theatres and stadiums be reopened thanks to vaccines   no     will the vaccinated be able to gather   no     what is the real benefit of vaccination   the virus won t kill you      are you sure it won t kill me   no     if statistically the virus didn t kill me anyway   why would i get vaccinated    to protect others      so if i get vaccinated  the others are      sure i m not infecting them   no so the shot does not give immunity does not eliminate the virus does not prevent death does not guarantee you wont get it does not prevent you from getting it does not stop you passing it ondoes not eliminate the need for travel bans does not eliminate the need for business closures does not eliminate the need for lockdowns does not eliminate the need for masking so what the hell is it actually doing  amazing interestingso why should one get vaccinated to make the pharmaceutical corporations richer bollywood actress pooja bedi also shared the viral message on her twitter handle   what we found out the first part of the message containing question and answers is true  it is fact that one has to take precautions and continue to show covid appropriate behaviour even after getting the vaccine  the second half of the message  however  is riddled with factual inaccuracies  claim    the shot does not give immunity the two covid    vaccines approved in india   covishield and covaxin   are two dose vaccines  the efficacy rate of covishield vaccine is reported at      percent  however  studies are still being conducted to see the difference in efficacy when the second dose is delayed  according to fact sheet released by serum institute of india  you may get protective immune response four weeks after the second dose of covishield vaccine   the final efficacy data for phase   human trial of covaxin vaccine is yet to be released  but the vaccine maker bharat biotech has said that immune response is seen two weeks after the second dose   claim    does not eliminate the virus it is not vaccines role to eliminate virus  as per the united states centres for disease control and prevention  cdc   vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection  this type of infection  however  almost never causes illness  but it does cause the immune system to produce t lymphocytes and antibodies  claim    does not prevent death the vaccine produces antibodies in the body of the recipient which ensures that the person does not get severe infection  therefore  the claim is false as the vaccine reduces the chances of death due to the infection  claim    does not guarantee you wont get it no vaccine is     percent effective against any virus  so  this claim is true but it is important to note that without the vaccine  the chances of getting severe illness remains high  claim    does not prevent you from getting coronavirus this claim is misleading as one might still get the virus after being completely vaccinated  the impact will not be the same as when they get the infection without being vaccinated  as dr shahid jameel explains in this video   claim    does not stop you passing it on this is true  as mentioned previously by dr jameel  it is possible that vaccinated person can transmit the disease  claim    does not eliminate the need for travel bans anthony fauci  director of the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said that    to    percent of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold which will mean it will be safe for countries to remove travel restrictions  therefore  the restrictions cant be removed immediately as it will take time to vaccinate larger populations  claim    does not eliminate the need for business closures as mentioned previously  it will only be safe to open businesses completely after majority of the population is vaccinated  claim    does not eliminate the need for lockdowns although lockdowns restrictions in india have been relaxed  it wont be correct to remove all the restrictions until large part of the population is vaccinated against the vaccine  this claim is  therefore  misleading  we need more people to be vaccinated to be able to remove more restrictions

a team of researchers who worked on similarly designed hiv vaccine in the     s warned  in commentary piece for the lancet  that some covid    vaccines in development or in limited use that are built with an  ad  viral vector  may increase the risk of hiv acquisition in men   the risk discussed in this editorial  which remains theoretical as it concerns covid    vaccines currently in development  concerned only males  no study has documented an increase in hiv susceptibility for women with ad  vector vaccines    in commentary piece published by the medical journal the lancet in october       several researchers argued that special caution around one form of covid    vaccine in development was warranted  the authors were each part of past efforts to develop an hiv vaccine in the late     s  two clinical trials associated with this effort  known as the step and phambili studies  revealed an association between vaccination with immunization and the acquisition of hiv in men  over decade ago  we completed the step and phambili phase  b studies that evaluated an ad  vectored hiv   vaccine administered in three immunisations for efficacy against hiv   acquisition  both international studies found an increased risk of hiv   acquisition among vaccinated men  an ad  vectored vaccine is one that uses genetically modified version of human virus known as an adenovirus Â  specifically adenovirus   or ad  Â  in the case of covid     adenoviruses  which can cause mild colds in humans  are modified to create sars cov   spike proteins  which train your immune system to fight off potential covid infection  only one covid    vaccine in limited use  cansino biologics convidecia  uses the same ad  viral vector as the step and phambili hiv vaccine  few other candidates in much earlier stages of research use ad  vectors  according to the new york times vaccine tracker  the california based company immunitybio is testing what is effectively the convidecia vaccine  the product is in phase i trials  the san francisco based company vaxart has begun phase i trials of an oral covid    vaccine that also uses an ad  vector  the maryland based company altimmune has entered phase i trial of an ad  vaccine delivered by nasal spray  south korean biotech company cellid has entered phase i trial of covid    vaccine based on combination of two strains of adenoviruses  one of which is ad   the fear articulated in the lancet editorial is that the ad  vector itself  not the modifications made to it for vaccine  could impart some increased risk of acquiring hiv Â  this is in part because during the trials of the hiv vaccine  both studies found that the association with hiv acquisition involved an ad  construct that did not have the hiv   envelope  this association held for both heterosexual and homosexual men  but was strongest for men who were uncircumcised and ad  seropositive  and who reported unprotected insertive anal sex with partner who was hiv   seropositive  raising the possibility that the vaccine increased the risk of penile hiv transmission  the increased risk of hiv   acquisition appeared to be limited to men  the authors wrote  the fear that ad  vectored vaccines could increase susceptibility to hiv is not fringe notion  the lancet is one of the worlds most prestigious medical journals  and this same concern has been raised by several other scientists in the past  including the national institutes of healths anthony fauci  the results of two vaccine concepts based on recombinant adenovirus serotype   pointed to potential major problem  fauci wrote in an april      editorial in science about the step and phambili trials  that such vaccines might increase susceptibility to hiv infection  what does this mean for covid    vaccination at the moment  for most people in the world at the time of this reporting  the answer is not much  the concern here is only with ad  vaccines  other adenovirus vector vaccines  subsequent research has demonstrated  do not impart this risk  at the moment  only the cansino biologics vaccine  convidecia Â  uses an ad  vector  it is currently approved for limited use in china and is close to receiving approval for limited use in russia  it has  as well  entered phase iii trials in several countries including pakistan  russia  mexico  and chile  according to the new york times vaccine tracker  russia is reportedly close to approving the vaccine as well  both the hiv and covid    pandemics disproportionately affect vulnerable populations globally  the editorial reads  roll out of an effective sars cov   vaccine globally could be given to populations at risk of hiv infection  which could potentially increase their risk of hiv   acquisition  this important safety consideration should be thoroughly evaluated  they argued  before further development of ad  vaccines for sars cov    and informed consent documents of these potential risks should reflect the considerable literature on hiv   acquisition with ad  vectors  snopes reached out to susan buchbinder  an epidemiologist with the san francisco department of health and the university of california  san francisco  who is listed as the primary author of the editorial  to ask if any subsequent information coming from subsequent covid trials have alleviated these concerns about hiv transmission  we also asked if the writers recommendations have been incorporated by countries testing or using ad  vaccines  we did not receive response  but will update our piece if we do receive one  because scientists did indeed make this warning about ad  vector vaccines  but because their data suggested this risk applied only to men  and most pointedly to specific subset of men   we rank the claim that researchers have warned that form covid    vaccine in development could potentially increase the risk of acquiring hiv as mostly true,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
by claim  remdesivir has been restricted to vaccinate people in african countries in order toÂ  experiment on them and produce genetically modified human beings  false  rather  the manufacturer of the

for the treatment of hepatitis and the ebola virus infection in       after the outbreak of the coronavirus  studies found that it proved effective as an antiviral drug in the treatment of covid    patients and shortened recovery period  in may       the u s  food and drug administration  fda  authorised the drug for emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed covid    in adults and children hospitalised with severe disease  it was the first drug approved by the u s  regulatory body for covid    treatment  shortly afterwards  it was also approved for use by the united kingdoms national health service  nhs   the world health organisation  who   however  stated in november      that it was conditionally advising against the use of the drug as there was no evidence at the time that it improved survival and other outcomes in patients Â  the evidence suggested no important effect on mortality  need for mechanical ventilation  time to clinical improvement  and other patient important outcomes  the un agency said after reviewing data from over       patients across four trials  the manufacturers of remdesivir  gilead  announced last year that they signed non exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with nine pharmaceutical companies based in egypt  india and pakistan to expand the drugs supply  the companies  namely cipla  hetero labs  and jubilant lifesciences  were to ensure the drugs distribution in     countries  the countries consist of nearly all low income and lower middle income countries  as well as several upper middle  and high income countries that face significant obstacles to healthcare access  the company explained  the licences are royalty free until the world health organization declares the end of the public health emergency of international concern regarding covid     or until pharmaceutical product other than remdesivir or vaccine is approved to treat or prevent covid     whichever is earlier  under the agreements  the companies were exempted from paying royalties to gilead and could set their own prices for the drugs generic version they would be producing  we are confident that these long standing voluntary licencees can efficiently scale up production of high quality  low cost remdesivir  said gilead spokesperson  ryan mckeel  generic drugs are generally the same as brand name and  according to the fda  have the same dosage form  safety  strength  route of administration  quality  performance characteristics  and intended use  what this means is that it is the same remdesivir that is being administered in the various countries  one of the generic versions of remdesivir  covifor  has been sold in india since june       about the label which says the drug is not to be distributed in the u s   canada  and european union countries  the spokesperson for hetero labs  one of the licencees  explained that it was to prevent the drug from being sold illegally on the black market  we think that this photo is part of malicious campaign to create confusion around this drug  the spokesperson added about the claim in circulation  gilead had confirmed this too  telling reuters that the labels only indicated restrictions in where the licencees could distribute the generic drugs  the claims are false  remdesivir is not vaccine specially made for africans but an antiviral drug found helpful in treating covid    patients and whose generic versions are being produced for countries in other regions of the world  including africa  the generic drug has exactly the same qualities as the brand name drug  the researcher produced this fact check per the dubawa,[1. 1. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

review   video of an interview  published by the new american on    january       featured lee merritt  an orthopedic surgeon and former president of the american association of physicians and surgeons  aaps   the aaps has previously published misinformation about vaccines and covid     during the interview  merritt made several claims regarding covid    vaccines and treatment  some of which were debunked in the past  the original video and its copies received more than        interactions on social media platforms including facebook  twitter  and reddit  according to social media listening tool buzzsumo  below  this review explains how several of merritts claims are inaccurate  misleading  the result of flawed reasoning and or unsupported by scientific evidence  why do we have vaccines  we have vaccines because we didnt have treatment for smallpox and it was very deadly disease that made sense to have vaccine  we didnt have treatment for polio initially  so  it  made sense to have vaccine but this  even without doing anything  this disease has           chance of survival  this line of reasoning is misleading  the purpose of vaccines is to prevent disease entirely and so avert the risks associated with the disease  while it is important to have an effective treatment  treatments cannot prevent disease  and the principle that preventing disease is always better than curing it is actually key concept of modern medical care around the world  furthermore  vaccines help to build herd immunity in population  this prevents the spread of an infectious disease in the community  thereby protecting individuals who are vulnerable to severe illness and are at greater risk of dying from the disease  like those with chronic illnesses and the elderly  treatments cannot build herd immunity  while vaccines are commonly associated with unpleasant side effects  such as fever  headache  and fatigue  these effects are milder and short lived compared to the risks that person runs with developing natural infection  for instance  in the case of covid     some survivors find themselves having to cope with persistent health problems that interfere with daily life  overall  the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks  given that safer alternative to acquiring immunity exists  suggesting that natural infection remains viable option for people to take  as merritt did  risks causing more harm to the community than is necessary  merritts claim that covid    has survival rate of         is false  for covid     the overall infection fatality ratio  ifr   or the proportion of people who die from the infection  has proved difficult to calculate  given that multiple variables in population  such as the quality of healthcare and age  can influence the ifr  but meta analysis of ifr estimates from different countries conducted by meyerowitz katz and merone reported an overall ifr for all ages at between      to           its really not vaccine  but whatever this thing is    the pfizer vaccine  this moderna vaccine  this rna thing  it doesnt prevent transmission by their own admission  okay  merritt appeared to echo an earlier claim made by david martin  which was covered in an earlier review by health feedback  it is false to claim that the covid    rna vaccines arent vaccines  by examining the definitions of vaccine by the u s  centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   the u s  food and drug administration  fda   and the world health organization  who   it is clear that the rna vaccines are indeed vaccines  the cdc defines the term vaccine as  product that stimulates persons immune system to produce immunity to specific disease  protecting the person from that disease  the fda explains how vaccines work  vaccines work by mimicking the infectious bacteria or viruses that cause disease  vaccination stimulates the bodys immune system to build up defenses against the infectious bacteria or virus  organism  without causing the disease  the parts of the infectious organism that the immune system recognizes are foreign to the body and are called antigens  vaccination exposes the body to these antigens  some vaccines contain weakened versions of bacteria or virus  other vaccines contain only part of the bacteria or virus  some vaccines contain only the genetic material for specific protein and direct the body to produce small amount of that protein  the bodys immune system reacts defensively once it detects this protein  after vaccination  the immune system is prepared to respond quickly and forcefully when the body encounters the real disease causing organism  and the who explains how vaccines work  vaccination is simple  safe  and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases  before they come into contact with them  it uses your bodys natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger  vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies  just as it does when its exposed to disease  however  because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria  they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications  the two covid    vaccines that were approved for emergency use by the fda  one co developed by pfizer and biontech and the other by moderna  meet the requirement for vaccine to prevent disease  therefore  both are vaccines according to the definitions outlined by the cdc and fda  preliminary data from clinical trials indicate that both vaccines have more than     efficacy in preventing covid    in vaccinated individuals  clinical trials are still underway  so estimates of each vaccines efficacy may change  whether the moderna and pfizer biontech covid    vaccines can prevent transmission is still unclear  work is underway to establish this  but scientists think it is likely for these vaccines to reduce transmission to some degree  in this quartz article  matthew woodruff  an immunologist at emory university  said  i cant imagine how the vaccine would prevent symptomatic infection at the efficacies that  companies  reported and have no impact on transmission  akiko iwasaki  an immunologist and professor at yale school of medicine  told the new york times  my feeling is that once you develop some form of immunity with the vaccine  your ability to get infected will also go down    even if youre infected  the level of virus that you replicate in your nose should be reduced  samuel scarpino  director of the emergent epidemics lab and assistant professor at northeastern university  told wired  we dont have any reason to think the pfizer and moderna vaccines wont block transmission  its just not what has actually been measured  and something we arent likely to find out until we either start mass vaccination and or they release more detailed information on the study locationsand epidemiologists start looking for effects of herd immunity  as john moore  virologist and professor at weill cornell medicine  said to the new york times  the more you reduce viral load  the less likely you are to be transmissible  but he added that all of these are things where data trumps theory  and we need the data  not only is hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine good for treatment  its good for prevention the claim that hydroxychloroquine and closely related compound named chloroquine are effective against covid    has been repeated often during the pandemic  however  scientific evidence provided by large scale  randomized controlled clinical trials showed that these drugs dont provide any meaningful benefit to patients  in terms of mortality and length of hospital stay  as earlier reviews by health feedback  here and here  explained  the u s  national institutes of health  nih  conducted clinical trials on adults hospitalized with covid    across    hospitals nationwide  press release by the nih stated that the interim results showed the drug neither caused harm nor improved patient outcomes  the trial had enrolled     of the expected     patients  the researchers findings were published in jama     the u k s recovery trial compared the outcomes for       patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and those of       patients who were given usual care only  statement by the trials chief investigators after review of the data reported that they found no significant improvement in    day mortality and no evidence of beneficial effects on hospital stay duration or other outcomes  the investigators concluded that these data convincingly rule out any meaningful mortality benefit of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with covid     their findings were published in the new england journal of medicine     the whos solidarity trial  which enrolled more than        adults across     hospitals in    different countries  among whom     were assigned to hydroxychloroquine treatment  also found no significant improvement in the mortality of hospitalized covid    patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  when compared to standard of care  the findings were published in the new england journal of medicine     nor has hydroxychloroquine shown itself to be effective at preventing covid     randomized clinical trial that included more than     healthcare workers found that hydroxychloroquine didnt significantly reduce the incidence of covid    in the workers     another randomized clinical trial in more than       healthcare workers likewise found that hydroxychloroquine treatment didnt reduce the incidence of covid        overall  high quality scientific evidence contradicts merritts claim that hydroxychloroquine is good for treatment and prevention  theres very small percentage of people that are in the icu or dying  who are those people   t he indonesians    looked and they found out that    the biggest  biggest thing is what your vitamin d level was  if it was above     your chance of being in the icu was less than four percent of sick people in the hospital    so  the  biggest thing people can do is get their vitamin d level up merritt didnt cite the title of the actual study she referred to nor did she mention the names of its authors  making it difficult for viewers to verify her claim  however  the paper described by her bears strong resemblance to this one  which was at one point uploaded to ssrn  repository for research preprints  preprints are studies that have not been peer reviewed or published in scientific journal   note that the preprint is no longer available on ssrn   however  group of researchers from indonesia pointed out several anomalies about the preprint and its authors  published in letter to the british journal of nutrition      w e assessed the preprint manuscript for validity and found several issues      the authors did not mention specifically the name of the hospitals  or the number of hospitals  and how they obtained the confidential data for their manuscript  similar to the surgisphere incident   at the time this paper was written  there were only two cases of confirmed covid     both survived  in sukamara regency  where the sukamaras regional public hospital is located  currently  the hospital is not regional referral centre for covid    care  none of the authors is affiliated to the ministry of health other governmental hospitals  and they did not acknowledge any of them      the name of the ethical institutional review board was not mentioned  and there is no ethical clearance for the study      vitamin d is not routinely checked in indonesia  the data collection method was retrospective  which is suspicious  finally  we called the covid    administration for sukamaras regional public hospital  which is allegedly affiliated with the authors  upon confirmation  the administrator told us that no authors names that we mentioned worked in this hospital  it is unclear if merritt was aware of these issues with the preprint  however  the anomalies detected in the paper  described above  indicate that the reliability of its findings are in question  at any rate  using single preprint to claim that vitamin d insufficiency causes higher covid    mortality rate is misleading  the role of vitamin d levels in preventing covid    and severe disease is still being investigated by scientists  vitamin d is important for health  it is involved in the absorption of calcium and is therefore critical for maintaining healthy bones and teeth  vitamin d deficiency can lead to loss of bone density  which in turn contributes to disease called osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures  there are also indications that vitamin d can influence our bodys immune response to infection     and as explained in this earlier review by health feedback  several studies reported correlation between vitamin d deficiency and an increased risk of developing covid    or severe covid     overall  there are grounds for investigating whether vitamin d levels influence the risk of infection and severe disease  however  such work is still in progress and it remains unclear whether the lack of vitamin d causes higher risk of infection or severe disease  for example  the correlation that researchers observed in these studies could also be explained by the fact that people with certain chronic illnesses like cancer  are more likely to have vitamin d deficiency to begin with  and scientific evidence shows that patients with certain chronic illnesses are more likely to develop severe covid     as of january       the world health organization and the u s  national institutes of health have not issued recommendation for vitamin d supplementation to treat or prevent covid     however  vitamin d deficiency is common  review article published in the european journal of clinical nutrition reported that the estimated prevalence of vitamin d deficiency stands at     in the u s       in canada  and     in europe  while more than     of the population in india  tunisia  pakistan  and afghanistan are affected     therefore  despite the lack of conclusive evidence about the benefit of vitamin d in preventing covid     some health authorities recommend that people take vitamin d supplements to avoid negative health effects due to deficiency  however  people should also be careful not to overdose on vitamin d supplements  excessively high vitamin d levels over prolonged period can potentially damage the bones  kidneys  and heart  i believed early on in february that this was biologically manipulated bioweapon the origins of the virus that causes covid     named sars cov    is still unknown  the presence of laboratory studying viruses in the initial epicenter of the pandemic in wuhan  china  led to multiple speculations  like merritts  that the virus was product of that laboratory  however  there is no evidence to support the speculations that the virus was biologically manipulated  some individuals claimed to have evidence showing that the virus was genetically engineered  however  closer examination of the purported evidence in these cases proved that these were the results of shoddy methodology and unsubstantiated assertions  as documented in reviews by health feedback  indeed  the available evidence favors the hypothesis that the virus occurred naturally  for example  experts who studied the genetic features of the virus didnt detect signs of genetic engineering  in addition  researchers discovered coronaviruses similar to sars cov   that were isolated from wild animals  as reported in this news article by nature from november       alice latinne  an evolutionary biologist at the wildlife conservation society vietnam in hanoi  told nature that these discoveries are exciting because they confirm that viruses closely related to sars cov   are relatively common in rhinolophus bats  and even in bats found outside china  referring to these viruses collected from wildlife and stored in laboratories to be analyzed later  as is typical of zoonotic disease surveillance programs  aaron irving  virologist and assistant professor at zhejiang university in haining  china  added that the findings also suggest that other as yet undiscovered sars cov   relatives could be stored in lab freezers  these findings indicate that wild animals are likely to be reservoir for sars cov   and or its closest ancestor  on top of this  about     of emerging infectious diseases reported worldwide are zoonotic diseases  according to the world health organization  who   zoonotic diseases are caused by the transmission of disease causing organisms from animals or insects to humans  experts have also considered the lab escape theory  which would not necessarily involve genetically engineered virus  this theory is viewed with skepticism  see this insight article by health feedback for detailed explanation   one reason for this is that the theory is supported largely by circumstantial evidence and is unsupported by genomic analyses and publicly available information  however  viruses have escaped from laboratories and caused infections before  as this vox article reported  overall  while one cannot rule out an accidental lab leak as the actual source of the outbreak as there is no evidence for or against that theory  the weight of scientific evidence and prior probability rather point towards zoonotic infection by naturally occurring virus  merritts belief that the virus was engineered is unsubstantiated and contradicted by the evidence  there have been four different vaccines and three different animal studies  in  cats and ferrets    they started after sars  and  after mers  they tried it in ferrets and something else  and what happened is all the animals died    but they didnt die of the vaccine  what they died from was called immune enhancement or    antibody dependent enhancement  they call it ade now     heres what happens     when they challenge those cats with sars  what happened is instead of killing the virus     the virus came into the cats body like trojan horse unseen by the cats own immune system merritt repeated the claim that covid    vaccines will lead to more severe covid    due to process called antibody dependent enhancement  ade   this claim was previously reviewed by health feedback  scientists found that the claim was unsupported by evidence  ade occurs when antibodies are unable to neutralize virus infectivity  but instead enhance virus ability to infect cells  the potential danger posed by ade is one that scientists developing vaccines are mindful of  this is due to previous experiences with vaccine candidates for other coronaviruses  such as the virus sars cov    which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome  as well as coronaviruses that infect animals  in the case of the former  researchers developed vaccine candidate for sars cov   using inactivated  killed  virus  which was tested in mice  they observed that vaccinated mice showed more severe lung disease upon infection with live virus      in the case of the latter  cats that were vaccinated with recombinant virus vaccine survived for shorter period of time compared to unvaccinated cats      vaccine candidate against the respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  also failed human clinical trials  as it caused more severe illness in vaccinated people      the lessons learned from the past led researchers to be cautious about covid    vaccines  as such  the vaccines authorized for emergency use by the fda are carefully monitored for ade and other severe side effects  indeed  clinical trials so far havent shown any indication that ade occurs in people who received the covid    vaccines  in health feedbacks previous review  sanjay mishra  staff scientist and project coordinator at vanderbilt university medical center who is also working in the covid    and cancer consortium  pointed out  the major vaccine candidates that have so far progressed in the large scale phase   trials  such as the ones by moderna  pfizer  and astrazeneca  have all ruled out any serious safety concerns  walter orenstein  professor at emory universitys school of medicine and associate director of the emory vaccine center  also agreed  vaccine enhanced disease is theoretically possible with sars cov   vaccines  but it has not been seen as of yet in the clinical trials reported  this review was updated to address readers questions about another of merritts claims regarding antibody dependent

social media post claims more than half of participants across various age ranges in modernas first covid    vaccine trial had adverse reactions  despite the recipients purportedly representing an

chronic conditions as long as they were deemed unlikely to risk the persons safety during the treatment period  dr phillip reece  senior fellow in the department of pharmacology and therapeutics at the university of melbourne  told aap factcheck entry criteria for phase one trials were intended to be restrictive  as the initial phase i trial is the first trial in humans  only healthy subjects are recruited to avoid the risk of harm to those with other medical conditions  volunteers can vary significantly in their medical status at screening  so it is not surprising if large number do not meet the entry criteria  dr reece said in an email  the facebook post highlights the number of adverse reactions experienced by the perfectly healthy group in the trial to cast doubt on the safety of the vaccine  however  additional information in the unverified safety summary report  which lists every purported reaction experienced during the phase one trial  states the majority of reactions were mild and not caused by the vaccine itself  among the       age bracket  for example  it stated    of the    participants     per cent  experienced    unsolicited adverse reactions  of these     were deemed unrelated to the vaccine  while    were classed as mild  examples of adverse events included in that tally  according to the report cited in the post  but not necessarily linked to the treatment include everything from mild sunburn and mild arthropod bite to flatulence  decreased appetite  hypertension  increased energy and nasal congestion  supplementary data included with the published preliminary report notes    unsolicited adverse events among the       group  none of which were serious  the majority were mild and unrelated to the vaccine  nikolai petrovsky  professor of medicine at flinders university in adelaide  told aap factcheck in an email that minor adverse reactions are extremely common in vaccine trials  in total  having more than half of the participants in the vaccine trial report mild and transient adverse events is completely normal and to be expected  prof petrovsky said  when regulator looks at such data  they are not interested in the total number of adverse events which are mainly mild and transient but instead will focus on the incidence of serious adverse events  particularly those that could potentially be life threatening  associate professor paul griffin  an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at the university of queensland  told aap factcheck that large number of adverse events  particularly if they were severe and related to the vaccine  would lead to the phase one trial being discontinued  and the vaccine wouldnt have proceeded to the phase three stage  the fdas eua review of the moderna vaccines phase three trial said that adverse events were reported in higher proportion of vaccine recipients than placebo recipients due to reactogenicity  or the expected inflammatory response soon after vaccination  page      the review said there was no difference in serious adverse events between the vaccine and placebo groups  four people died during the trial period in both groups  however none of the deaths were deemed related to the treatments  if the related events are similar to what is seen in the placebo group  then that means theres not significant issue with the actual vaccine itself  prof griffin added  the post falsely claims that modernas covid    vaccine phase one trial only involved extraordinarily healthy participants with perfect bmi and blood pressure readings  when in fact candidates could be overweight and experiencing hypertension along with other medical conditions  it also quotes figures on adverse reactions during the trial that is missing important context  while participants did experience range of adverse reactions  the majority of those reactions were mild Â  and no serious events were linked to the vaccine  according to experts from the university of melbourne  university of queensland and flinders university  it is expected that mild adverse reactions would be reported in phase one trials  partly false  content that has some factual inaccuracies

with an arrow pointing to the circled word  in the comments on the post  one user has written  wonder what the   is  probably the same as covid  to which the post author replied  much higher than the       mortality rate of c at the time of writing  the december    post had been shared    times and attracted more than    reactions and comments  with the us suffering the worlds highest recorded death toll from covid     the fda issued an emergency use authorisation  eua  for the pfizer biontech vaccine on december    to combat the virus  in statement accompanying the announcement  fda commissioner stephen m  hahn described the eua as significant milestone in battling this devastating pandemic that has affected so many families in the united states and around the world  nevertheless  polls show many americans are reluctant to take covid    vaccine  with the possibility of side effects due to the speed at which treatments have been developed cited as primary concern  the facebook post image draws attention to the inclusion of deaths in the list of possible adverse event outcomes  the source of the original text featured in the image  minus the drawn in elements  is an fda advisory committee meeting in late october  pg         an fda spokeswoman confirmed to aap factcheck via email that the source was an official briefing document for the october    meeting  however  the spokeswoman added  no specific vaccine was discussed at that meeting  but rather that meeting was held to discuss  in general  the criteria fda may take into account when making decision about emergency use authorisation for covid    vaccine  the list of adverse events on slide    is list of possible outcomes that the fda may potentially monitor for when conducting safety surveillance  this slide was not referring to particular vaccine candidate  neither of the fdas fact sheets on the pfizer biontech vaccine for patients or health care providers mention death among its possible side effects  the only items on the fdas working list  as featured in the facebook post  that are included in the possible side effects are joint pain and allergic reactions  although the fact sheet for patients notes serious and unexpected side effects may occur from taking the vaccine and it was still being studied  fact check by the associated press  ap  after the pfizer biontech vaccine received eua approval found that social media posts claiming the fda was intentionally burying the vaccines possible life threatening side effects had misrepresented the same slide  the pfizer biontech has also been falsely connected to deaths that occurred during its phase three trial  as previously explained by aap factcheck  week after issuing the first approval  the fda issued an eua for modernas covid    vaccine  fact sheets on the vaccine  see here and here  provide similar side effect warnings to those for the pfizer biontech product  they do not mention death as possible outcome  the facebook posts author also suggests in the comments that the mortality rate for covid    is        however previous aap factcheck investigations have shown the death rate among those infected with the coronavirus is likely more than    times this figure  see here  here and here   the facebook post has the potential to mislead as it emphasises deaths among possible covid    vaccine side effects  while the author also falsely states in the comments that the death rate from the vaccine may be higher than the death rate from the virus  the fda confirmed to aap factcheck that its list of adverse event outcomes included all possible side effects it may monitor for when conducting safety surveillance on vaccines  and did not relate to any specific covid    vaccine  with the exceptions of potential joint pain and allergic reactions  none of the side effects on the list are among those in the fdas official advice on its approved covid    vaccines  missing context  content that may

thalidomide was miracle drug commonly prescribed in the     s to treat an assortment of ailments  including nausea in pregnant women  the therapeutic was not rigorously tested in large human populations and was pulled from the market less than decade after its introduction because it caused malformations in newborns   thalidomide was not rapidly approved using comparable approval requirements necessary in      for the covid    vaccine  furthermore  thalidomide is not vaccine  and does not provide possible case study for long term safety and efficacy concerns related to the two dose coronavirus immunization   after    year old british woman became the first person to receive the covid    vaccination in december       claims made in social media posts compared the immunization to thalidomide  miracle drug commonly prescribed around the world in the     s to treat variety of ailments  from morning sickness to the common cold  but the miracle was short lived  with less than decade on the global pharmaceutical market  thalidomide was taken off the shelves when it was found to cause malformations and congenital defects in infants born to women who had been prescribed the drug  and because thalidomide was prescribed before rigorous long term testing proved its safety in variety of populations  including pregnant women  some are quick to point out that the thalidomide tragedy could prove as precedent for health effects to come in the wake of the covid    global vaccinations   but does decades old medical catastrophe set the stage for possible health impacts caused by the covid    vaccine  experts say no  there is no fair comparison  said dr  ruth blue  secretary to the board of trustees of the thalidomide society  in an email to snopes  while it is true that thalidomideÂ was marketed in some countries in      to treat nausea and insomnia in pregnant women  and withdrawn five years later due to malformations in newborns  thalidomide was an often daily therapeutic drug aimed at treating symptoms and not an immunization to prevent viral infections and spread  thalidomide was developed in the late     s and early     s and was prescribed to pregnant women to ease morning sickness  anxiety  insomnia  and host of other complaints  it had not been properly tested in already and non pregnant women  and  there were troubling side effects of the drug  blue said  vaccines are tried and tested science  they do not work the same way that thalidomide did  furthermore  thalidomide was not approved in the u s  until decades after the tragedy  and only after healthcare experts studied the long term safety and efficacy effects of the therapeutic  ironically  the thalidomide tragedy led to the long term  multi phased approval process required by regulatory agencies around the world  thalidomide was originally marketed as sedative and first introduced in germany in the     s  because the over the counter medicine was advertised as safe drug for all users  including pregnant women and children  it was eventually used in at least    countries by       the cure all was marketed under number of names including distaval  asmaval  forte  tensival  valgis  and valgraine  and was used to treat an equally vast number of symptoms  from nausea in pregnant women to anxiety  colds  flu  and pneumonia  its widespread use was largely contributed to early clinical studies involving rats  not humans  that found it was impossible to overdose on thalidomide  but its long term use wasnt studied until it was too late  by the early     s  it became apparent that thalidomide resulted in severe birth defects in thousands of children around the world  according to research published in the journal toxicological sciences  the thalidomide society  united kingdom based support group for victims  estimates that more than        children around the world were affected with an estimated        children having been born with phocomelia  rare congenital disorder that causes very short limbs  as well as congenital heart disease  and malformations of the inner and outer ear  it is thought that another         women experienced still born births or had miscarriages  it wasnt until      when australian obstetrician william mcbride warned in letter to the medical journal lancet that he observed multiple severe abnormalities in babies that he had delivered and whose mothers had taken thalidomide during pregnancy  in what has now become known as the thalidomide tragedy  mcbrides letter eventually led to ban of the drug around most of the world in       though thalidomide was prescribed around the world  its approval was put on hold due to the u s  food and drug administration  fda  approval requirements  pharmacologist dr  frances kelsey turned down several requests from the distributing company because she did not feel its researchers had provided clinical evidence necessary to suggest the drug was safe  in short  thalidomide was neither approved nor used in the u s  until       however  two unregulated clinical trials treated about        people with thalidomide before actions were taken to prevent the drugs distribution  according to report by the new york times detailing      fda investigation  thalidomide was also casually passed doctors and family members  investigators ultimately concluded that the drug manufacturer richardson merrell was illegally promoting the drug before it had been approved  but did not have definitive proof to pursue further legal action  after more than three decades of rigorous testing  thalidomide was approved by the fda in the u s  for the treatment of leprosy  multiple myeloma  and other diseases  including some forms of cancer  but it still doesnt compare to the covid    vaccine  first and foremost  thalidomide is not two dose vaccine  vaccine development requires four phased review process to determine whether the immunization is safe and for how long it may be effective  vaccine development can typically take several years before reaching approval  but in december       the fda issued two emergency use authorizations  eua  for covid    vaccines developed by pfizer biontech and moderna in response to the covid    pandemic  even so  the agency noted in dec     statement that eua does not constitute approval  in determining whether to issue eua for product  the fda evaluates the available evidence to determine whether the product may be effective and also assesses any known or potential risks and any known or potential benefits  if the product meets the effectiveness standard and the benefit risk assessment is favorable  the product is made available during the emergency Â  as such  the fda expects vaccine distributors authorized under eua to continue clinical trials to obtain additional safety and effectiveness information and pursue eventual approval Â  ironically  the thalidomide tragedy marked turning point in toxicity testing  prompting regulatory agencies to more closely examine systematic pharmaceutical testing for long term safety and efficacy both in the prescribed patient and unborn fetuses Â  thalidomide was not necessarily fast tracked drug as many of the social media posts claim  the oral tablet was not trialed at the magnitude modern pharmaceuticals and therapies are tested  and its long term safety and efficacy were not tracked in large human populations until it was too late  like vaccinations  fda approval of drug also requires four phases and series of clinical trials to determine whether it is safe and effective at its prescribed use  phase   typically emphasizes safety and will monitor between    and    patients  very small sample size  to determine the drugs most frequent side effects and how the drug is metabolized and excreted  in the second phase  researchers will test hundreds of patients in often controlled trials to determine the effectiveness with the goal of obtaining preliminary data on whether the drugs work in people with certain conditions or diseases Â  following phase    the fda will determine how large scale studies will be conducted in phase    at which point thousands of patients will be given the drug for data collection at much larger scale Â  approval then requires number of steps that could take place over several months  once drug is approved  phase   entails post marketing risk assessment that requires the fda to continue to monitor and evaluate safety updates  standard review typically takes around    months whereas priority review takes around six  according to the fda  because of these protocols  treatment protocols for thalidomide usage in      are strict in determining whether patient is pregnant at the time of taking the drug  as of this writing  thalidomide is regulated by the system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  steps  program  which aims to educate patients who receive the drug about potential risks  among other measures  women who could become pregnant must agree to undergo pregnancy testing before starting the medication  and continue to do so during the course of their therapy to prevent the risk of fetal exposure to thalidomide,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

social media posts claim vaccines are not safe  pointing to      billion paid out by the united states  but us health authorities say testing ensures vaccines are safe and effective  and most government compensation results from settled claims in which it was not concluded the vaccine caused the alleged injury   with billions paid out for v ccine injuries  and with only    of v ccine injuries ever reported  it doesn t take genius to work out that v ccines are neither safe or effective   claim facebook posts from november            if you re pro v ccine  not only are you anti

compensation  which oversees the vicp  told afp via email   the united states has the safest  most effective vaccine supply in history  most people who get vaccines have no serious problems   as the below video from the us centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  shows  vaccine safety is carefully tested via clinical trials  monitored throughout the manufacturing process and reviewed after the vaccine is widely distributed in the community   in the     s  series of lawsuits alleging vaccine related injury led to decrease in the number of vaccine manufacturers  resulting in rising vaccine costs  to help ensure stable and affordable vaccine supply  congress passed the national childhood vaccine injury act of       it led to the establishment of the vicp in      as an alternative to the traditional tort system   only vaccines and injuries included in the vaccine injury table    typically those recommended for routine administration to children or pregnant women    are covered by the vicp  the program is funded by an excise tax of       added to the cost of each vaccine dose  in the rare case that vaccine causes serious problem  such as severe allergic reaction  the vicp  rather than the manufacturer  may provide financial compensation to the injured individual   the hrsa division of injury compensation emphasized that  being awarded compensation for petition does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the alleged injury   it explained that as much as    percent of the compensation paid by the vicp is the result of settlement where the program  has not concluded  based upon review of the evidence  that the alleged vaccine s  caused the alleged injury    the posts are correct that the vicp has paid out approximately      billion in compensation  but dorit rubinstein reiss  professor of law at uc hastings college of the law  said   focusing on the number  rather than the rate of compensation  when it s    year old number  when it s number that covers relatively few cases of harm  is misleading   the      billion also includes around      million in lawyers  fees  the vicp pays attorneys  fees whether or not the case is awarded compensation   reiss said this can incentivize  lawyers to bring lot of claims  to bring claims without evidence  to bring claims without good basis   however  she also said paying lawyer s fees is the  right thing to do  even if there may be some who abuse the program   i think it is an ethical duty of society to compensate the rare cases of vaccine harm  and to get compensated  they need representation  by covering the cost  we re helping people get representation   according to hrsa  from                billion doses of vaccines covered by the vicp were distributed in the us  during that same time period       petitions were compensated by the vicp    this means for every one million doses of vaccine that were distributed  approximately one individual was compensated   the hrsa explained  the posts also reference study by harvard pilgrim health  the study   electronic support for public healthvaccine adverse event reporting system   covered the period from december         to september             more than    years ago    and it did find that  fewer than one percent of vaccine adverse events are reported    the study said that the vaccine adverse event reporting system  vaers   program co managed by the cdc and the food and drug administration  fda   needed improvement  the cdc s immunization safety office said via email   vaers is national in scope and can quickly provide an early warning of safety concern with vaccine    the program compiles reports of  adverse effects  or any health problem after vaccination from vaccine manufacturers  physicians who are required by law to report any adverse event listed in the table of reportable events following vaccination  and from members of the public  the data is publicly available and can be searched here  the immunization safety office said   one potential explanation for low reporting of mild events might be that many are expected  and therefore people don t feel the need to report them  as an example  sore arms are an expected event after certain vaccines so people may decide not to report this event to vaers   it also pointed to      study that found  vaers sensitivity for capturing anaphylaxis after seven different vaccines ranged from    to    percent   in addition to vaers  vaccine safety is also monitored by the vaccine safety datalink  the clinical immunization safety assessment  and post licensure

the claim was shared by an australian based facebook user here  the post has been shared more than     times Â  the post purports to compare the progress of developing covid    vaccine with other areas of medical research Â  it states     years worth of research no vaccine for hiv  at least     years of research no vaccine for cancer  ongoing research no vaccine for the common coldÂ   less than year for covid vaccine Â   i think ill pass on that shot  Â  sars cov    the virus that leads to the disease covid     was first reported to the world health organization on december           the virus has since spread to almost every continent on earth  infecting more than    million people and killing more than     million people  according to johns hopkins university Â  similar claim was shared by facebook users hundreds of times here  hereÂ and here  the claim  however  is misleading  human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  attacks the cells in the body that help fight infections and diseases and can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  aids   the virus is primarly contracted during unprotected sex and can be fatal Â  however  medications now available for hiv prevent the degradation of the immune system and reduce the risk of disease associated with the virus  people who are hiv positive are now often able to live healthy and long life  some medications have been shown to even prevent the transmission of the virus  this page on the website for the australian federation of aids organisations gives more details  university of western australia virologist associate professor alison imrieÂ told afp in an email that hiv and sars cov   are very different viruses  hiv inserts itself into our dna and remains there until those cells die  whereas sars cov   does not  also  hiv mutates at much greater rate than sars cov   so the immune response cannot control it  she said in the december    email Â  the relatively good news about sars cov   is that although this virus also mutates  it does not change as quickly as many other viruses  such as hiv  influenza  and rhinovirus  one of the viruses that causes the common cold  so the covid    vaccines are more likely to be successful as the virus does not change fast enough to be able to escape the immune response the vaccines will produce Â  the american national cancer institute explains here that cancer is collection of related diseases that are primarily caused by cells which begin to divide and spread to surrounding tissue  as cells become more and more abnormal  old or damaged cells survive when they should die  and new cells form when they are not needed  these extra cells can divide without stopping and may form growths called tumors  the website reads Â  according to professor imrie  cancer is not single microbe or change in the body  unlike covid    which is caused by single virus  sars cov     cancer can be caused by plethora of different reasons including viruses  she said  the fight against covid    is easier as this is disease caused by infection with one virus  she said Â  only between    and     of all cancers are caused by viruses  but vaccines have been shown to help prevent some cancers caused by viruses  according to this article by the american society for microbiology  the hpv vaccine  which can help prevent the human papillomavirus which leads to variety of cancers Â and hepatitis b vaccine  which can help prevent liver cancer caused by the virus  are just two examples Â  the common cold is caused by number of groups of different viruses  including coronaviruses  rsv and parainfluenza  but rhinoviruses are the most common  most of these viruses will lead to people becoming sick  but our immune systems will generally fight them off  according to the us centers of disease control and prevention  cdc   Â  after we have developed an immune response to particular virus  we will often become immune to any future exposure to the same virus  but not to the other hundreds of other similar viruses  imrie said Â  pharmaceutical companies won t invest in developing hundreds of vaccines for viruses which are relatively benign  and we likely won t want to pay lot of money for hundreds of vaccinations against viruses which don t cause serious disease  she added Â  flinders university associate professor of microbiology and infectious diseasesÂ jill carrÂ told afp in an email the common cold also is not perceived as having devastating impact on the economy or public health  thus  in the environment of limited funding for research  the big impact diseases are given much more focus  she said Â  according to professor imrie  the mrna vaccines for covid    have been developed relatively quickly because the technology used in them has been in development since      for other coronaviruses like mers and sars  when those diseases seemed to disappear  vaccine funding dried up but some of the technology had been developed and was ready to apply to sars cov   and covid     she explained Â  also  basic research that has been going on in universities around the world  supported by government and by philanthropic organisations including gates foundation  resulted in discoveries that have been applied to the new covid    vaccines  she said Â  professor carr said the amount of resources devoted to finding vaccine  advances in technology and collaboration among scientists are all factors that have spurred progress towards finding covid    vaccine so quickly Â  these basic platforms  and scientific networks have expedited developing covid    vaccine candidate  and the streamlining of the process that couples basic science to clinical trials  regulatory approval and manufacture have helped all these different arms of the process work together  the financial risk has been mitigated by political support for guarantees of outcomes for manufacturers  investment  so pharmaceutical companies have lower risk for taking on the vaccine candidate for manufacture  she said,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

head of pfizer research  covid vaccine is female sterilization   reads the headline of an article  screenshot of which has been shared across facebook  instagram and twitter since december          posts making similar claims have been circulating in german and portuguese  also read  no  pfizer biontech covid    vaccine does not contain nanotechnology the article cites former pfizer researcher michael yeadon whose linkedin profile says he left pfizer  where he worked on allergy and respiratory research  in         eight years before the start of the coronavirus pandemic  yeadon claims that the covid    vaccine  which was first administered to the public on december    would train the immune system to attack protein involved in placenta formation  syncytin    leading to infertility for women  this is not how the messenger ribonucleic acid  mrna  vaccine  developed in cooperation with the german company biontech  works  according to dasantila golemi kotra  an associate professor in microbiology at york university   the mrna vaccine works by providing the body with an instructional molecule  such as mrna  that tells the human cells how to synthesize the viral protein  the infamous spike protein    she told afp in an email  the  mrna  vaccine  such as the one developed jointly by pfizer and biontech  does not contain any protein from the virus itself  but rather the instructions for the body to synthesize viral protein so that the immune system learns to defend itself against it  it differs from regular vaccines in that instead of confronting the immune system with part of virus in weakened or deactivated form to build antibodies  it gives it  blueprint  of part of the virus  the spike protein  that the body can then recognize and fight when confronted by it later  golemi kotra said   the concern over the possibility that the anti spike protein antibodies could attack the syncytin   protein of the placenta because the spike protein of the novel coronavirus shares very short amino acid region with the spike protein is very small   she explained that the immune system can  recognize surface in their target protein  which rarely is confined to single short amino acid sequence   sanjay mishra  study coordinator at vanderbilt university  agreed  saying by email that  countless publications have shown that infection with sars cov   induces antibodies against viral spike protein   therefore it can be safely assumed that vaccination with the viral spike protein will also direct antibodies only against the targeted spike protein and nothing else   mishra said  annette beck sickinger  professor at the university of leipzig  said that  if this syncytin claim was true  every woman who has been previously infected with covid    would consequently be infertile  but this is not the case   although the pfizer biontech vaccine is the first to use mrna commercially  mrna was discovered in the early     s  with animal testing starting in the     s  this vaccine  was tested  because of the scrutiny  with even higher standards in terms of how we do things   pfizer ceo albert bourla said during briefing on december    dervila keane  pfizer spokeswoman  also said that  there is no data to suggest that the pfizer biontech vaccine candidate causes infertility    it has been incorrectly suggested that covid    vaccines will cause infertility because of very short amino acid sequence in the spike protein of sars cov   virus that is shared with the placental protein  syncytin     keane said   the sequence  however  is too short      shared amino acids    to plausibly give rise to autoimmunity  additionally  cohort comparing the outcomes of pregnancies with and without intercurrent sars cov   infection shows no difference in outcomes   she added  although no evidence has been found of adverse effects on pregnant women so far  mostly because the clinical trials did not intentionally include pregnant women  the uk government advises to wait until the pregnancy is over to get vaccinated  for the general population   the data monitoring committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine   keane said  it concluded that  the vaccine was well tolerated  with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination  the only grade    severe  solicited adverse event greater than or equal to   Â in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at      and headache at      following dose     she said  details of the pfizer trial can be found here  also

effects including death  the vaccine does contain variation of the molecule  butthe additive  is not in pure form  i e  as just polyethylene glycol but as chemical modified version of it likely to make it amenable to the application   york university s golemi kotra explained  for people with documented allergies to the additive she said Â  aÂ consultation with doctor is the best way to go   the

source  robert f  kennedy jr   children s health defense  this past weekend with theo von     dec        Â                  review   the covid    vaccine developed by pfizer and biontech is the first covid    vaccine to be administered to the general population  in particular healthcare workers  having received emergency use authorization from the u s food and drug administration  fda  on    december       since then  many posts and articles on social media have claimed alleged safety issues  one example is this video interview between theo von and robert f  kennedy jr  in the video  kennedy claims that the covid    vaccine does not prevent transmission and that the short follow up period in the clinical trials does not ensure vaccine safety  the video was first published on youtube on    november      but went viral on facebook in mid december  receiving more than        interactions in two days  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  the record time in which covid    vaccines were developed has raised some concerns about its safety  however  the speed with which the vaccines were developed is not because regulatory agencies have been reducing the standards so that they can pass the vaccine no matter what  as kennedy asserts  rather  the rapidity of the development process was achieved through avenues such as increased funding  recruitment  and the removal of bureaucratic red tape  as health feedback explained in this previous review  covid    vaccine candidates have passed the same safety standards as any other vaccine candidate before approval and public use  and covid    vaccine frontrunners have demonstrated high level of safety in clinical trials       like any other vaccine  covid    vaccines can cause side effects  such as fever  fatigue  sore muscles  and headaches  but these effects are mild  short lived  and do not result in lasting damage  however  the u k  medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency advised that people with history of severe allergic reactions should avoid taking the pfizer biontech vaccine for the moment  following adverse reactions in two healthcare workers who have history of severe allergies  contrary to kennedys claim  vaccines are not associated with higher risk of developing chronic diseases  such as diabetes  or autoimmune diseases  as health feedback covered in earlier reviews  furthermore  kennedys claim that you are not going to see bad side effects till maybe year out is misleading  severe adverse events generally occur within the first six weeks after vaccination as director of the fda peter marks explained in   december      covid    vaccine update hosted by the american medical association  ama   the issue of  two month  follow up has been talked about lot  but the rationale here is that most  that is about     of the serious adverse events with vaccines become apparent within about six weeks and certainly within two months of the administration of the vaccine  so this at least helps us feel comfortable that when we deploy these vaccines  that theres anything thats in significant way of serious adverse event  we will have seen it  researchers observed no serious vaccine related adverse effects in tens of thousands of people who received the vaccines in phase   trials      for median of at least two months of follow up  in the case of the pfizer vaccine  some early stage participants received the vaccine six months ago  indicating that it is also safe over longer period  however  even after approval  regulatory agencies and manufacturers continue to monitor vaccinated individuals to collect more safety and efficacy data and to identify potential rare adverse eventsoccurring in less than      of the populationwhich may only become apparent when very large number of people receive the vaccine  on the other hand  the emergency use authorization might partially compromise long term data if many volunteers from the clinical trials drop from the placebo group to receive the covid    vaccine  in clinical trials  both researchers and participants are blinded  meaning that neither party knows whether participants received the vaccine or placebo  however  once vaccine shows efficacy against the disease  trials typically become unblinded  which means that the researchers inform participants to which group they belong  although kennedy called this practice dishonest trick  it is actually an ethical issue  since an effective vaccine can protect person from disease  it would be unethical not to make it available to participants  therefore  volunteers can choose whether to cross over to the vaccine group or stay in the placebo group for long term follow up and only receive the vaccination once the trial is over  while this practice can impact long term data collection  there are also strategies to limit such disruptions while continuing the trial  like monitoring these participants in separate group  besides safety  kennedy claims that another problem with the covid    vaccine is that it does not prevent transmission  however  this claim is premature  it is true that most clinical trials only assessed how many people became sick with covid    after vaccination but have not yet evaluated whether the vaccine prevented infected people from transmitting the virus to others  if the vaccines fail to prevent or reduce the risk of transmission  then vaccinated people could remain susceptible to infection  albeit asymptomatically  and transmit it to others  that is why people will need to continue practicing public health measures like wearing face masks  frequent handwashing  and physical distancing until more data becomes available  however  some vaccine candidates will likely prove to be able to reduce transmission  for instance  the interim results from the oxford astrazeneca vaccine candidate released in november      and new data from moderna showed that the vaccinated groups had fewer asymptomatic infections  this finding suggests that the vaccine could indeed reduce transmission to some degree by preventing people from getting infected  pfizer and moderna are also evaluating the presence of viral antibodies in the blood of trial participants to know how many of them became infected after immunization and assess whether the vaccine reduced the number of asymptomatic infections  additional studies will be needed to assess if the vaccine can limit the amount of virus in the nose and throat of infected people enough to reduce transmission to others  in summary  several stages of clinical trials ensure the safety and efficacy of vaccines before public distribution  contrary to kennedys claims  severe adverse reactions are rare and generally occur within the first six weeks after vaccination  therefore two month follow up is long enough to assess vaccine safety in most cases  results from phase   trials in thousands of participants demonstrate that covid    vaccines are generally safe and can protect against the disease  however researchers have not yet determined their efficacy in preventing transmission  rendering premature kennedys claims that they dont  this article in nature summarizes the first compelling evidence on the efficacy of covid    vaccines and its implications for managing the pandemic

posters on number of facebook groups  including saving scotland  which has       members  are highlighting the fact pregnant women have been excluded from the programme to suggest that the vaccine is not safe for use in the general population  widely shared post which was gathered from government websites states that people are being used as the lab rats  ferret fact service looked at the claim and found it mostly false  the roll out of the vaccine  which has been developed by pharmaceuticals giant pfizer and german biotechnology firm biontech  is being managed on priority basis  following advice given by non governmental panel the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation  part of that advice  which has received significant media attention  is to avoid giving the vaccine to pregnant women because there are  sic  no data as yet on the safety of covid    vaccines in pregnancy  either from human or animal studies  it is common for drugs licensed for use in the uk to carry warning stating that they should not be taken by women who are either pregnant or intending to become pregnant  that is not because those drugs have been found to carry risk to those women or their unborn children  but rather because they have not been tested on women who are pregnant Â  many vaccines are safely used by pregnant women  such as flu and whooping cough  but it is standard practice to avoid recommending new drug until enough evidence has been gathered  pregnant women have historically been classed as vulnerable group so including them in trials was deemed unethical  without any data to show that particular drug is safe for use in pregnancy  however  manufacturers must warn that it might not be  not everyone is in agreement that pregnant women should be excluded from clinical trials  the concept of vulnerability  which has been the focus of much debate in relation to the covid    vaccine  is in itself contested issue in the medical world  in relation to pregnant women       study published in the journal of medical ethics found it was inappropriate and disrespectful to classify pregnant women as vulnerable because that categorisation is otherwise applied to populations whose decision making capacity about research participation is somehow compromised  in       the us food and drug administration  fda  said that as some pregnant women will also have chronic medical conditions that require treatment it could do more harm than good not to allow them to have particular treatment  it may  therefore  be unethical to exclude them from trials  the fda said Â  regardless of this  the pfizer biontech trials did not deliberately seek to recruit any pregnant women  so no data exists on how the vaccine might impact on them or their foetuses  professor jonathan van tam  the deputy chief medical officer for england  has noted that number of women who volunteered for the trials have since become pregnant and that if enough data can be gathered from them the guidance may change in future  how was the pfizer biontech vaccine tested before being approved Â  all new drugs must go through series of trials before they can be licensed for use  although there are usually four phases of trials in humans  the fourth phase is designed to monitor how drug works in real life situations after it has been approved for use  that is why fourth phase trials are also known as post marketing surveillance trials  on its own website  pfizer states that phase   trials generally last from between one week to several months  phase   trials take up to two years  phase three trials last from between one and four years  and phase   trials take at least year to conclude  the process was accelerated for the covid    vaccination in view of the unprecedented nature of

dr richard hatchett  chief executive officer of the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations  said this was achieved by the companies taking  financial  risks with the manufacturing process  but notwith the clinical development  they have sped up the development largely by  in parallel  making investments in manufacturing processes that ordinarily you might delay until you had data from your early stage clinical trials  he said Â  the phase   clinical trial of the pfizer biontech drug ran between july and november and involved        participants  just as the development of the vaccine was expedited  so too was the approval process  the uk governments medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  mhra  gave the drug temporary authorisation for emergency use on   december after carrying out so called rolling review that began in october  rolling reviews allow the regulator to assess data as they become available rather than waiting for clinical trial to end Â  as the mhra has granted temporary rather than full authorisation of the drug it can rescind its approval at any time  it has already made temporary change to guidance on who should receive the drug after two nhs staff with history of significant allergies reported adverse reactions Â  pregnant women are not recommended to take the vaccine because they were not included in the clinical trials  it has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials and deemed safe for the public  the vaccine is now in the surveillance stage  where manufacturers observe the general population for any adverse reactions,[1. 1. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

from experiments with corona vaccines in cats  for example  in the course of these studies all cats that initially tolerated the vaccination well died after catching the wild virus  put simply  an antibody is made by the bodys immune system  and attaches to something on the surface of virus  usually attacking it or rendering it harmless  most vaccines work by giving the body harmless version of protein on the surface of the virus so it can make these antibodies  which would speed up the bodys ability to fight infection if it gets the real disease later  you can get these antibodies from having had the infection  having been vaccinated  or being treated with blood plasma from people whove had the infection which contain them  non neutralising antibodies are antibodies that can attach to these proteins on the surface of virus  but dont actually kill or harm them  it has been found that in some cases in cats  they may actually help the infection take hold  antibody dependent amplification  or ade  is very rare example of these non neutralising antibodies making the infection worse  as well as some observations in cats  theres solid evidence this happens in humans with dengue fever Â  its true that vaccine against different kind of coronavirus in cats did kill those cats that were vaccinated sooner than those not  but the mechanisms of ade are not well understood  and this could have been down to number of different factors Â  despite this  there isnt much evidence that ade is problem in human coronavirus infections  ade happening with different disease in non

infection worse  due to the use of plasma from people who have had covid    as treatment for those suffering with an infection  studies of how effective this is are ongoing  but if ade were risk here its likely that would have been observed by now  the much too short duration of the study does not allow realistic estimation of the late effects  as in the narcolepsy cases after the swine flu vaccination  millions of healthy people would be exposed to an unacceptable risk if an emergency approval were to be granted and the possibility of observing the late effects of the vaccination were to follow  there are many reasons why this covid    vaccine has been quicker to develop than any other vaccines  the vaccine has been trialled extensively as all vaccines are  but much of the analysis

did researchers develop vaccine for covid    in year  while vaccines for hiv  cancer and the common cold remain elusive  yes  but it s not an apples to apples comparison  the diseases are different from one another  which means that the challenges around creating vaccines for them are distinct  hiv mutates faster than coronaviruses do  many forms of cancer aren t caused by virus  and there are    in fact    vaccines for some viruses that can lead to cancer  while colds aren t caused by single virus  complicating efforts to develop an effective vaccine  the claim appeared in an instagram post  archived here  on november           the post read  this is what users saw on social media  post shared by boyce watkins   therealboycewatkins     the post included screenshot of news article announcing new covid    vaccine  user s comment was posted underneath and circled in red  the comment read     years worth of research no vaccine for hiv at least     years research no vaccine for cancer ongoing research no vaccine for the common cold less than year for covid vaccine  thanks but hard pass on that shot  the post is missing important context because it fails to consider the important differences between those diseases  hiv  for example  presents challenges that are distinct from those presented by sars cov    the virus behind covid     stat news explained  sars cov   causes an acute disease  covid     it s an infection that most people will clear on their own  which means there s vanquishing immune response that vaccine can aim to induce in order to protect people  that s not true for something like hiv  virus for which there is no vaccine despite decades of research  hiv causes chronic infection and integrates itself into people s genomes  there s no natural immune response that eliminates the virus that vaccine can mimic  hiv also mutates much faster than coronaviruses do  meaning it s more difficult to rally lasting defense  similarly  cancer and covid    present very differently  there are many different types of cancer  and lot of them aren t caused by virus  however  some viruses can lead to cancer  and there are vaccines for some of those viruses  for example  human papillomaviruses  or hpvs  can cause cervical and other cancers  the hepatitis b virus can also increase the risk of cancer  specifically liver cancer  both hpv and hepatitis b vaccines are available  lastly  the post mentioned the common cold  asking why there s not vaccine for the disease  despite years of research  the answer is twofold  first  it s usually mild illness and researchers generally focus their energy on diseases that are lethal  second  some     different varieties of viruses can cause colds  complicating efforts to develop an effective vaccine  in sum  there are countless differences between covid    and hiv  cancer and the common cold  although vaccines typically take years to develop  it s not impossible or unreasonable that researchers were able to develop vaccine for covid    in record time  while other vaccines remain in the works  every disease is unique  the path to understanding each and developing vaccines is distinct  too,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

source  facebook user  facebook     nov       Â      summary   facebook post claiming that the covid    vaccine will lead to more severe disease  was published in november      and went viral on the social media platform  similar claims have also been published in other social media posts  like this one and this one  the claim is based on the observation of more severe disease occurring in individuals who received dengue vaccine and vaccine candidate for the respiratory syncytial virus  both are likely due to phenomenon known as antibody dependent enhancement  ade   however ade has not been shown to occur in individuals that received covid    vaccines to date  one of the authors of these posts previously claimed to be toxicologist  despite lacking the necessary training and credentials for that title  health feedback reached out to experts to find out how ade works and whether the claim is supported by scientific evidence  see scientists feedback in full   angeline rouers  research fellow at the singapore immunology network  explained  ade is well known mechanism which was described for the first time in dengue patients  it occurs when antibodies do not neutralize the virus to prevent its entry into the target cells  for example  but instead facilitate the infection of other cells  such as macrophages  type of immune cell   however  rouers added that there is no clear evidence showing that the virus which causes covid     sars cov    can infect macrophages  walter orenstein  professor at emory universitys school of medicine and associate director of the emory vaccine center  said  vaccine enhanced disease is theoretically possible with sars cov   vaccines  but it has not been seen as of yet in the clinical trials reported  sanjay mishra  staff scientist and project coordinator at vanderbilt university medical center who is also working in the covid    and cancer consortium  concurred  the major vaccine candidates that have so far progressed in the large scale phase   trials  such as the ones by moderna  pfizer  and astrazeneca  have all ruled out any serious safety concerns  he said  overall  all three scientists agreed that close monitoring of vaccinated people is important to ensure that ade can be safely ruled out as side effect of covid    vaccines  but for the moment  the evidence has not shown the vaccines to have such an effect  indeed  preliminary findings released by frontrunners moderna  pfizer  and astrazeneca have shown that among the trial participants who did develop covid     those who received the vaccine did not show higher rates of severe disease compared to those who received the placebo  the vaccines were also able to prevent covid    at high efficacy  however  an important caveat of these findings is that these trials are still underway  and the number of people included in these interim analyses is relatively small  apart from the posts unsupported claim linking ade with covid    vaccines  its suggestion that non neutralizing antibodies are always ineffective for protection is inaccurate  the immune system has several ways to deal with viruses  and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  which can involve non neutralizing antibodies  is another mechanism that is distinct from neutralization  that is also important for protective immune response  rouers pointed out  and contradicting everlys claim that no one is concerned about it  health feedback was able to find multiple articles published over the course of      that discussed concerns about ade with respect to the covid    vaccine  some examples are this article in the scientist  this article in pnas and these two articles in nature       the latter two being highly respected journals in the scientific community  overall  while ade is theoretical possibility with covid    vaccine  clinical trials in people so far have not shown that participants who received the vaccine have higher rate of severe illness compared to participants who did not receive the vaccine  given the paramount importance of vaccine safety  scientists continue to encourage rigorous safety monitoring so as to completely rule out ade as potential side effect    scientists feedback    sanjay mishra  staff scientist  vanderbilt university medical center  antibody dependent enhancement  ade  of virus infection    is phenomenon in which virus specific antibodies enhance the entry of virus and in some cases  ade can even facilitate the infection     ade has been well established in dengue    and zika viruses  and any poor quality antibodies that bind the virus but do not neutralize can cause ade  indeed  some vaccine candidates  such as one against the respiratory syncytial virus resulted in deaths due to ade     however  no definitive role for ade in human coronavirus diseases has yet been established  despite the concerns raised       the opinion piece being cited in the viral facebook post itself concluded that the risk of ade remains theoretical in vaccines being developed against sars cov    the major vaccine candidates that have so far progressed in the large scale phase   trials  such as the ones by moderna  pfizer  and astrazeneca  have all ruled out any serious safety concerns  while more data is still needed  randomized controlled trial with convalescent sera has also shown to be beneficial in covid    patients with moderate disease severity     just like other things related to this pandemic  we should wait and watch for better evidence to completely rule out ade  but no evidence for ade has been found so far   angÃ©line rouers  research fellow  singapore immunology network  ade is well known mechanism which was described for the first time in dengue patients  it occurs when antibodies do not neutralize the virus  to prevent its entry into the target cells  for example  but instead facilitate the infection of other cells  such as macrophages  it might also happen with coronaviruses but for the moment  there is only in vitro demonstration of this with regards to sars cov    the mechanisms in vivo might be different and there is also no clear evidence showing that sars cov   can infect macrophages  as note  it is false to say that non neutralizing antibodies are inevitably non efficient and potentially dangerous  as suggested in the facebook post  antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity  which can involve non neutralizing antibodies  is another mechanism that is distinct from neutralization that is also important for protective immune response  this claim is particularly alarming for the public and unnecessarily invokes conspiracy theory  most people dont know this  most people have never heard of this  maybe the big media networks dont find this important to share with the public  or maybe its just plain censorship  its probably censorship  in fact  ade is an immune response that is well known to scientists and is described in immunology textbooks  ade has to be assessed from the earliest stage of vaccine development  there is nothing hidden from the publicif ade is detected during vaccine development  it will simply stop the trials  we can never be      sure it will not happen in some way at later stage of clinical trials  but in the whole history of vaccines  this phenomenon is very rare  the post also mentions that   antibodies might not be the most protective aspect in the context of sars cov   and  b  there is positive correlation between severity and level of antibodies in the patients  these claims are true but require more context to avoid readers misunderstanding    cytotoxic t cells have indeed been shown to be very important to fight the virus  however  antibodies are also doing part of the job and should not be neglected   b  the level of antibodies is not necessarily predictive of their efficiency  indeed  high level  quantity  of antibodies might not be protective  and can even make things worse in the case of ade  but high level of efficient  i e  neutralizing  antibodies is generally good prognosis  overall  it is very important to keep in mind the difference between what is observed in the patients and what vaccine aims to do  vaccine does not aim to reproduce the immune response observed in an infected patient  on the contrary  it aims to elicit neutralizing antibody response to fight the virusthis is something that is rarely observed in severely ill patients  ade is concern that scientists have in mind and will assess carefully  some vaccine candidates may have led to ade at the early stages of trials  which halted their development  this demonstrates that the scientific community is careful and will do everything possible to release safe vaccine for people  in conclusion  ade is theoretical danger in sars cov   vaccine development  but it is taken seriously into consideration and very close monitoring will be applied   walter  orenstein  professor  emory university school of medicine  thus far  there are no data supporting vaccination as cause of vaccine induced enhanced disease  such enhancement has been seen with other vaccines such as the dengue vaccine  but for the vast majority of vaccines in use today around the world  such enhancement has not been seen  there were concerns seen in animal studies with earlier coronavirus vaccines for sars cov   and mers  but not in human studies to date  vaccine enhanced disease is theoretically possible with sars cov   vaccines  but it has not been seen as of yet in the clinical trials reported  in contrast  sars cov   is killing more than      people day in the us alone  it will be important to monitor to see if enhanced disease happens  but there is no evidence for it in humans to date  in contrast

comment on the british medical journal  bmj  website claiming people who refuse future covid    vaccine could face prison terms and hefty fines has been widely shared online  facebook post from the natural nutritionist page includes meme with text that mirrors the first line of the comment  five years imprisonment and or         fine for refusing coronavirus vaccination   the post text then duplicates the bmj comment in full  including claim that under the australian biosecurity act       refusers of coronavirus vaccination in australia could be at risk of five years imprisonment and or         fine  this emergency power has been active since march       and has been extended to december       with the potential for unlimited extensions  it says  its possible this emergency power could be extended until coronavirus vaccine is available  and that people in australia could be under duress to have coronavirus vaccination  i e  at risk of imprisonment and or huge fine  for virus which is not threat to most people under     the end of the post includes the additional lines  when will the remaining experts with conscious  sic  raise their concerns over this  coerced vaccination is illegal  at the time of writing  the november   post has been viewed more than        times and shared more than     times  attracting over     reactions and     comments  the bmj comment has also been shared by other social media users in australia and new zealand  see examples here and here   while it is possible for authorities to issue control orders to specific individuals to get vaccinated  the federal government cant use the biosecurity act to make vaccines mandatory across the broad population  two legal experts told aap factcheck  the australian government has also said covid    vaccine will not be made mandatory  and that emergency powers granted under the act were not intended for the enforcement of national immunisation programs  with multiple potential vaccines in development to combat the virus  australia has entered into agreements to secure access to at least four different vaccine candidates and more than     million potential doses  according to government press release from november    however  concerns have also been raised about people being forced or coerced into taking the vaccine  prime minister scott morrison initially said in august he expected the vaccine to be made as mandatory as you could possibly make it  and the only exemptions should be on medical grounds  but later on the same day he stepped back from the comments  saying there would be no compulsory vaccine but there will be lot of encouragement and measures to get as high rate of acceptance as possible  following national cabinet meeting of state and territory leaders on november     mr morrison reiterated that covid    vaccine would be strongly encouraged but not mandatory  the claim in the facebook posts repeats bmj comment in response to an article from the journals editor  fiona godlee  that questioned the value of hastily developed covid    vaccine  the source of the comment  which suggests covid    vaccination could be enforced under the biosecurity act  is listed as an independent person investigating the over use of vaccine products and conflicts of interest in vaccination policy from adelaide  the biosecurity act came into effect in      and lays out australias plan to protect itself from biosecurity threats like pests and diseases that can affect plants  animals or humans  associate professor patrick emerton  legal theorist from monash university in melbourne  said the posts hypothesis  that refusers of coronavirus vaccination could be at risk of imprisonment or fines  was simplistic and failed to unpack the conditionalities of the act  there are two pathways under the act for vaccine requirements  it can be made an entry condition  which is already similar to how yellow fever works in australia  and lot of other countries  and it could also be made condition under control order  which could be issued against an individual who has been found to have symptoms or have been exposed  he told aap factcheck in phone interview  that control order could include requirement to be vaccinated  theres no process for exercising force to impose the vaccination  but if you refuse to be vaccinated  then youve committed an offence  which could result in fine or imprisonment as punishment  dr emerton added that these measures were unlikely to be used aggressively due to lack of popular support  paula obrien  director of the health law and ethics network at melbourne law school  told aap factcheck in an email there were serious restrictions on the scope of human biosecurity control orders  hbcos  under the act  an order could state  for example  that an individual receives  at specified medical facility  specified vaccination  she said  restrictions under the act include  the hbco can only be used on certain high risk individuals  section         the order must be matter of last resort under strict principles  section      force cannot be used to require compliance  section      and the procedure must be carried out in manner consistent with appropriate medical and professional standards  section      there is only risk of penalty if hcbo and biosecurity measure is in place requiring vaccination  and it is simply not possible to imagine the government making millions of these orders to get the population to vaccinate against covid  dr obrien said  these are not general laws which apply to all of us but such an order could be made against an individual if all of the requirements set out were met  dr obrien said there were also rights for an order to be reviewed in court  however  anyone breaching an order could be imprisoned for up to five years or fined     penalty units  which currently equates to          she said it was very unlikely at this stage that the commonwealth would use this provision to enforce the use of covid    vaccine for specific individuals  dr obrien added that  generally  if the government wanted to do something very intrusive of individual rights and freedoms  it would need to pass fresh laws through parliament in order to do so rather than rely on delegated authorities under existing public health laws  i have little doubt that  if direction for vaccination by all people in victoria were made by the cho  chief health officer  under section      of victorias public health and wellbeing act       and if it were challenged in the courts  the courts would say it was unlawful for such requirement to be imposed on the population under delegated legislation  she said  spokeswoman for the department of health told aap factcheck vaccinations were not mandatory in australia  and individuals would maintain the option to choose not to vaccinate  this right will extend to any covid    vaccination that may become available  she said  the spokeswoman said emergency powers under the biosecurity act were intended to be time limited  and they would be removed when the public health evidence supported doing so  it is not the intention of the human biosecurity emergency power to enforce national vaccination campaigns  she said  two legal experts told aap factcheck that it is possible for governments to issue control orders for specific individuals to be vaccinated  and defying these orders exposed people to the risk of fines or jail  however  they said existing laws could not be used to make blanket order across the population  and it was very unlikely they would be deployed in the case of covid    vaccine  government representatives have also said the commonwealth did not intend to use biosecurity powers to enforce vaccinations  nor would covid    vaccine be made mandatory  partly false  the content has some factual inaccuracies  aap factcheck is an accredited member of the international fact

source  anonymous  facebook     nov       Â      review   facebook video published on    november      claims that aborted fetal tissue is present in the covid    vaccine produced by astrazeneca and oxford university  and that the vaccine can change persons dna  shared by the anti vaccine facebook group we are vaxxed  the video has received more than         views and more than        interactions on the social media platform  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  several vaccines require the production of viruses  which can only replicate with the help of living cells  human cell strains have been used for decades to produce vaccines  although cells from animals have also been used for the same purpose  for example  the flu vaccine is commonly produced using fertilized chicken eggs  although more newly developed cell based flu vaccines use an animal cell line  specifically madin darby canine kidney cells  for growing the flu virus  certain vaccines involve the use of human fetal cell strains  notably the rubella vaccine  according to history of vaccines  website by the college of physicians of philadelphia  in total only two fetuses  both obtained from abortions done by maternal choice  have given rise to the human cell strains used in vaccine development  neither abortion was performed for the purpose of vaccine development  these two cell strains are named wi    and mrc   wi    is commonly used to produce the rubella vaccine  history of vaccines explains the origins of the rubella vaccine  in some cases  women who were infected with rubella while pregnant terminated their pregnancies due to the serious risks from congenital rubella syndrome  following one such abortion  the fetus was sent to  stanley  plotkin at the laboratory he had devoted to rubella research  testing the kidney of the fetus  plotkin found and isolated the rubella virus  separately  leonard hayflick  also working at the wistar institute at that time  developed cell strain called wi    using lung cells from an aborted fetus  hayflick found that many viruses  including rubella  grew well in the wi     and he showed that it proved to be free of contaminants and safe to use for human vaccines  claims that the cells used to grow viruses for vaccines are present in the vaccines themselves were previously reviewed and found to be inaccurate by health feedback here and here  the vaccine knowledge project by oxford university explains  for some vaccines  the active ingredient is grown in laboratories on cultures that contain human cells  some viruses  such as chickenpox  varicella   grow much better in human cells  after they are grown  the viruses are purified several times to remove the cell culture material  this makes it unlikely that any human material remains in the final vaccine  the vaccine education center of the childrens hospital of philadelphia  chop   even though fetal cells are used to grow vaccine viruses  vaccines do not contain these cells or pieces of dna that are recognizable as human dna  people can be reassured by the following  although fragments of dna may be present in the final vaccine  the amount is harmless  chop explains  the amount of human dna in the final vaccine preparation is minimal  trillionths of gram  and highly fragmented  because the dna is fragmented  it cannot possibly create whole protein that could be harmful and that  dna from the vaccine is not able to incorporate itself into cellular dna  the fragmented genetic material also does not differ from the genetic material people come into contact with everyday  for example through our diet  paul offit  pediatrician and professor of vaccinology at the university of pennsylvania  clarified in this      abc news report  there are perhaps nanograms of dna fragments still found in the vaccine  perhaps billionths of gram  he said  you would find as much if you analyzed the fruits and vegetables you eat  while the astrazeneca oxford vaccine uses human fetal derived cells for growing viruses  it is the hek    cell line  not the mrc  cell strain as claimed in the video  the study which was wrongly cited in the video as supporting evidence for this claim is preprint  which examined experimental methods for studying the vaccines effects  for example efficacy and safety  vaccines that use fetal derived cells in their production have faced objections by some on religious or moral grounds  as the cells used to produce the virus were originally derived from an aborted fetus  concerns over the use of such vaccines led the vaticans pontifical academy for life to issue statement in      that catholics could receive vaccines made using human fetal derived cells  if no alternatives are available  the technical characteristics of the production of the vaccines most commonly used in childhood lead us to exclude that there is morally relevant cooperation between those who use these vaccines today and the practice of voluntary abortion  hence  we believe that all clinically recommended vaccinations can be used with clear conscience and that the use of such vaccines does not signify some sort of cooperation with voluntary abortion  while the commitment to ensuring that every vaccine has no connection in its preparation to any material of originating from an abortion  the moral responsibility to vaccinate is reiterated in order to avoid serious health risks for children and the general population  lastly  the video claims  they know that this vaccine is going to hurt people or kill people so badly  this claim is baseless and unsupported by scientific evidence  before vaccine can be made available to the public  it must undergo safety and efficacy testing in clinical trials  see figure below   like all medicines  vaccines can produce side effects  however  common side effects from vaccines  such as fever and pain at the injection site  are mild and short lived   figurethe different stages of human clinical trials in vaccine development  modified from the original graphic by the u s  centers for disease control and prevention   serious adverse events have been reported during the clinical trials of several covid    vaccine candidates  as reported by mainstream media outlets including the bbc  the new york times  and cnn  it is important to note that these trials were halted once these events were reported in order to determine whether the events were related to the vaccine  the trials were only allowed to continue after safety data was reviewed and no relationship between the vaccine and the adverse event was detected  which is testament to the emphasis on vaccine safety  as this nature news report put it  the clinical hold shows that there are functioning checks and balances  in spite of political pressure  says marie paule kieny  vaccine researcher at inserm  the french national health research institute in paris  it might indeed remind everybody  even presidents  that for vaccines  safety is paramount  she says  this review has been corrected to remove an inaccurate reference to wi    as the product of fetus aborted due to congenital rubella

new covid    vaccines contain levels of mercury that cause brain damage  most commonly given vaccines in the uk do not contain the mercury based chemical thiomersal  we dont know if future covid    vaccines will contain it  but even if they do  there is no evidence that it causes harm in the amount contained in vaccines  our readers have asked us to check claims that new covid    vaccines contain enough mercury to cause brain damage it is likely this question refers to thiomersal  mercury based chemical  but this is no longer used in most standard vaccines in the uk  europe or the us  even if it was used in new covid    vaccine  there is no evidence that the amount that would be in it could cause any harm Â  thiomersal  or thimerosal in america  is mercury based preservative that is sometimes used in tiny quantities in multi dose vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi when the vaccine is opened Â  there are two types of mercury to which people may be exposed  methyl mercury and ethyl mercury  methyl mercury can be toxic to people  but ethyl mercury  which is contained in thiomersal  is quickly eliminated from the body so it does not build up to reach harmful levels Â  the world health organization  who  says safety concerns about the use of thiomersal in vaccines has been predominantly based on data regarding exposure to methyl mercury  rather than ethyl mercury  leading to initiatives to remove it from vaccines Â  it said  it is important to note that concerns about toxicity of thiomersal are theoretical and that there is no compelling scientific evidence of safety problem relating to its use in vaccines  although public perception of risk has been reported in some countries  thiomersal was removed from most uk vaccines between      and       although it was used in the swine flu vaccine used in the         and         flu seasons  it is not currently found in any vaccines routinely used in the uk Â  the university of oxfords vaccine knowledge project said it was removed from vaccines in the uk  europe and the us as precaution as part of global goal of reducing exposure to mercury from all sources  however  it says there is no evidence that thiomersal in vaccines caused harm  the us centers for disease control and prevention says most common side effects of thiomersal are minor reactions like redness and swelling at the injection site  in       an australian study of over million children found no evidence of link between thiomersal in vaccines and autism development  although thiomersal is rarely used now  it is possible that one of the many covid    vaccines currently in development will contain the preservative Â  as mentioned above  it was effectively used in the swine flu vaccine  the who still recommends use of vaccines containing thiomersal for global immunisation programmes because the benefits of using such products far outweigh any theoretical risk of toxicity,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

cited as the source of the information in the email  the canadian prime ministers office  which supposedly steered the group  also told reuters in an oct     report that there  is  no such committee in existence  look at the committees of the prime ministers cabinet and the committees of canadas parliament  both the house of commons and the senate  shows no such body   more  there is no world debt reset program under the international monetary fund  imf  that will set personal debts to zero in exchange for getting vaccinated for covid    and covid     the latter disease is nonexistent  it has not been mentioned in reports by the world health organization  who   and only corresponds to title of september      movie  the false claim might have been fallacious twist of the world bank and the imfs debt service suspension initiative  which defers debt payments of the worlds poorest countries  allowing them to instead use their money to mitigate the human and economic impact of the covid    crisis  imf managing director kristalina georgieva has also mentioned great reset or global economic reset  but her pronouncements never included total debt relief program as described by lynn channel  aside from reading the concocted roadmap  lynn channel made spurious pronouncements about covid    and the vaccines being developed for it  first  she warned viewers that vaccines have   live virus in them  this is misleading  of the four main types of vaccines  according to the who and the united states vaccine gov website  only live attenuated vaccines  lav  carry live but weakened version of virus  the other three types are  researchers in an article published sept    in the scientific journal nature have noted that the development of lavs for coronaviruses is particularly challenging because of the possibility that the live virus it contains would recombine with wild coronaviruses to recreate pathogenic strain  but of     vaccine candidates so far recorded by the covid    vaccine tracker of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicines vaccine center  only four are of the lav type  all of which are still in the preclinical trial stage  lynn channel also said the covid    vaccine is total hoax  since the virus causing the disease has long mutated  thus any vaccine that will be developed later will no longer be effective against future strains of the virus  studies have demonstrated the existence of other strains of sars cov    the covid    causing virus  such as the g    strain which replaced d    as the most dominant form of the virus  but experts  like those from the philippine genome center  said in august that at least for the g    strain  the mutation does not have lot of implications for covid    vaccine designs   see vera files fact sheet  the new coronavirus strain  explained  researchers from the australian governments national science research agency in october also found no evidence that the mutation will adversely affect the efficacy of vaccine candidates  lastly  lynn channel claimed the british government passed law allowing ordinary citizens to administer vaccines and freeing them from any liabilities in case they vaccinate someone incorrectly  this is untrue  as an amendment to the human medicines regulations       the u k  recently permitted more healthcare workers  including independent nurses  allied healthcare professionals  paramedics  physiotherapists  pharmacists  student nurses  and doctors  to administer flu and potential covid    vaccines  the amendment does not say ordinary people  the government also said these medical workers will undergo robust training programme before they are allowed to vaccinate anyone  and that no vaccine will be given to the citizens unless it has met stringent standards and has passed comprehensive clinical trials  lynn channels false post came week after president rodrigo duterte announced he already has the money needed to buy covid    vaccines

review   the covid    pandemic that has swept the world since early      sparked an intense research effort to uncover cures for it  to date  scientific and general public media outlets presented several molecules as possible cures for covid     such as hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir  since april  drug named ivermectin  which is used to treat parasitic infections  triggered public interest due to claims on social media that the drug can cure covid    and save lives  one example of this claim can be seen in this video by one america news network  some media touted it as wonder drug  which led several countries to include it in their official treatment recommendations for covid     however  scientific evidence supporting ivermectins use as covid    treatment is scant and appropriate clinical trials are still lacking  as this review explains below  the claim that ivermectin is proven cure for covid    started getting viral in the second half of       leading some countries to recommend it as covid    treatment  some studies report an antiviral effect of ivermectin on sars cov    the virus that causes covid     in the lab  however  the available clinical evidence is not strong enough to support the claim that ivermectin is treatment for covid     few clinical trials on ivermectins efficacy against covid    have reached completion as of january       most of the available data come from observational studies that do not have the same level of reliability as clinical trials  furthermore  their conclusions are mixed  ivermectin is molecule that is generally used to treat parasitic infections  it was discovered in the     s  winning its inventor nobel prize in       several studies found that ivermectin has an antiviral effect against large range of viruses  including sars cov         however  these data are purely in vitro  meaning that the experiments were conducted on cells growing in the laboratory and not in living animals or humans  following the discovery of its in vitro antiviral activity against sars cov    many laboratories assessed whether this molecule could be used to treat covid    in humans  david jans and kylie wagstaff  the author of an april      research paper that first described the in vitro antiviral activity of ivermectin against sars cov       counted    current clinical trials and surveys on the effect of ivermectin on covid    in humans     however  available information from clinical studies databases  such as clinicaltrials run by the u s  national library of medicine  indicates that only seven of those    reached completion and released their results  of them  only two are randomized  controlled  blinded clinical trials  which are considered the gold standard for testing drug safety and efficacy       in these trials  patients are randomly assigned to either group receiving the treatment  in this case  it would be drug regimen including ivermectin  and control group that receives placebo  by randomizing the group assignments  characteristics of the patients  such as age  sex  lifestyle  genetics  etc   are evenly distributed between the test group and the control group  blinded trials  as opposed to open label trials  means that patients and health practitioners are unaware of whether they belong to the test group or the control group to avoid any placebo effect  finally  clinical trials that are conducted on large populations minimize the impact of chance influencing the study outcomes  by contrast  in observational studies  researchers either follow the progression of disease in patients without intervening in their drug regimen or assess the outcomes of former patients based on knowledge about the treatment they received  observational studies are easier to set up and usually less expensive than clinical trials  which makes them useful tool  but they are also more prone to bias  as result  they are regarded as lower standard of evidence than clinical trials       as of january       the majority of available clinical results about ivermectin and covid    come from observational studies  therefore  the evidence available so far is informative  but not strong enough to support ivermectin as cure for covid     some studies report that ivermectin has positive effect on patients with covid     but the study designs are so variable that it is not possible to assess how useful ivermectin might be for treating covid     it is also unclear what dose of ivermectin should be administered and which patient groups it should be used for  for instance  randomized  controlled  blinded clinical trial on    hospitalized patients found that ivermectin alone  but not ivermectin given together with doxycycline  could speed up the viral clearance from covid    patients bodies  albeit without changing the duration of their symptoms  however  the authors note that the study sample was too small  n       to draw any solid conclusions     retrospective observational study looked at the course of covid    patients that received ivermectin and found they had lower mortality among heavily sick patients compared to those that didnt receive ivermectin     but the small size of the study and its observational nature  as opposed to randomized clinical trials  led the authors to warn  appropriate dosing for this indication is not known  nor are the effects of ivermectin on viral load or in patients with milder disease  further studies in appropriately designed randomized trials are recommended before any conclusions can be made  by contrast  other laboratories reported no effects of ivermectin on covid    in patients  an observational study on patients suffering from severe covid    symptoms showed no effect of ivermectin on their clinical or epidemiological outcomes      based on these results  andrew mclachlan  dean of pharmacy at the university of sydney commented  many of the current studies have low numbers of participants  weak study designs  and inconsistent  and relatively low  ivermectin dosing regimes  with ivermectin frequently given in combination with other drugs  in summary  some clinical data suggests that ivermectin might be beneficial for at least some types of covid    patients  however  the clinical data available so far is not strong enough to claim that ivermectin is treatment for covid     several scientific papers reviewing available evidence thus concluded  the clinical efficacy and utility of ivermectin in sars cov   infected patients are unpredictable at this stage    we await results of well designed large scale randomized controlled clinical trials exploring treatment efficacy of ivermectin to treat sars cov        it is clear that only the results from large rigorous randomized clinical trials will definitively establish ivermectins utility to treat or prevent sars cov   infection      the claim that the lack of support for ivermectins use at the administrative and political level amounts to murder implies that ivermectin effectively prevents covid    related deaths  however  the clinical evidence indicating that ivermectin could reduce mortality in covid    patients is weak  one observational study of     patients found that ivermectin would reduce the mortality among hospitalized covid    patients from      to           another retrospective study on     patients also found lower mortality among the patients group treated with ivermectin       as opposed to     in the control group      the majority of available studies to date did not assess the impact of ivermectin on mortality from covid     although these studies may appear encouraging at first  their design as observational studies rather than clinical trials limits the significance of their results  dominique costagliola  an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the pierre louis institute of epidemiology and public health in france warned that these studies contain limitations  for instance  it is difficult to ensure that the beginning of the observation period was the same for all patients in the study  for that reason  the authors of the study with     patients concluded  further studies in appropriately designed randomized trials are recommended before any conclusions can be made  in short  the available evidence is still limited and not sufficient to fully support the claim that ivermectin prevents covid    deaths  the video from one america news network also relayed statement by thomas borody  gastroenterologist at the center for digestive diseases in australia and proponent of the efficacy of ivermectin  borody claimed that ivermectin can work like vaccine because it would protect people from developing sars cov   infection  this claim is incorrect  even if ivermectin could prevent sars cov   infections in people  this effect would only last while people take the drug  by contrast  vaccines offer long lasting protection against infections  indeed  vaccines work by helping persons immune system recognize and build defenses against the pathogen without the risks associated with natural infection  this confers the vaccinated person with protection against future infection with the actual pathogen without the need for continuous medication  it is still unclear how long vaccine induced immunity will last in the case of covid    as it is novel virus  but current data indicates that it may last for at least eight to nine months  in summary  the claim that ivermectin is proven cure for covid    is unsupported at this point in time  some observational studies suggest that ivermectin can help reduce the amount of virus and improve covid    symptoms or mortality in infected people  however  the level of confidence in these studies is low  large  multi centric  randomized  controlled  blinded clinical trials are still needed to demonstrate the efficacy of ivermectin against covid     at the moment  there is no strong data to support the claim that ivermectin will significantly save more lives or protect people in the same way as vaccine  associated press also fact checked similar claims about ivermectin and found them to be unsupported    coronavirus Â covid    Â ivermectin,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

disappointed the government has thrown its lot in with covid    vaccine candidate that involves the hek     cell line  cultivated from an aborted human fetus  the leaders write that portion of the population will have an issue with the use of fetal cells and they ask that the vaccine not be made mandatory  while also requesting that an ethically uncontroversial alternative vaccine be made available  dr coatsworth addressed these concerns during press conference on august     video of which was shared on the department of healths social media channels  in the    second snippet of the

being used to develop covid    vaccines  university of auckland vaccinologist and associate professor helen petousis harris is chair of the world health organizations global advisory committee on vaccine safety  dr petousis harris told aap factcheck via email that aborted babies are not being used for the development of covid    vaccines  however  she said human cells were required in order to grow the covid    virus when developing certain vaccines as using these was the fastest and most reliable way to study human pathogens  dr petousis harris said some cell lines  established decades ago  were derived from cells from electively aborted fetuses and these lines are used in both medical research and the production of some vaccines  these include common vaccines for hepatitis  rubella  chickenpox and rabies  she said the cells used to develop vaccines are not the originally harvested cells but distant descendants of those cells  no cells of any kind are part of the final vaccine formulation  dr petousis harris said the oxford vaccines used hek     cells to grow the vaccine and the developers have published details of the manufacturing process that make clear this information  she said the hek     cells were derived from human embryonic kidney  hek  cells  the line was developed in scientist alex van der ebs dutch laboratory in about      from cells taken from single fetus  prof van der eb told us food and drug agency hearing in      that the kidney cells were likely obtained in      from an electively aborted fetus  and he did not know the reason for the abortion  page      dr petousis harris said other covid    vaccines were being developed from different human cell lines established in the     s  while some covid    vaccines would not require human cell lines at all  that said  all vaccines will have benefited during some stage of development from the use of human cell lines because studying the virus and immune responses in the lab inevitably use these cell lines to ensure reliable results that are relevant to humans  she said  an article co authored by professor megan munsie  research fellow dr chris gyngell and associate professor michelle taylor sands  all from the university of melbourne  Â investigated ethical issues relating to the oxford vaccine  the article said the oxford vaccine was manufactured using the hek     cell line as factories to make the component of the vaccine that carries genes from the sars cov   virus with the aim of triggering an immune response to protect the recipient when injected  the article said there were six covid    vaccines being developed that used human fetal cell lines  the use of fetal cell lines was ubiquitous in medical research  the article added  it reiterated that the cells used to manufacture the oxford vaccine were laboratory cultivated descendants of the cells originally obtained in the     s from an aborted fetus  and the vaccine itself would contain neither fetal cells nor fetal dna  an article in science mag has also detailed the use of fetal cells in vaccine development and found at least five covid    vaccine candidates used one of two human fetal cell lines  the hek     cell line  and the per c  cell line developed in       aborted babies are not being used to develop the oxford university covid    vaccine  as suggested in the post  instead  development of the vaccine will involve laboratory made descendants of cells derived from single aborted fetus in the     s  the vaccine contains no actual fetal cells or dna  experts say  partly false  content that has some

multiple facebook posts  like this one shared more than       times since august          make various claims about microsoft founder bill gates  who is regular target of conspiracy theorists because of his hefty donations to global healthcare projects over the years   the posts claim that gates  added sterilization formula to every single vaccine for the last    years   an allegation that the world health organization purportedly admitted in court  the posts also claim that in       the who purportedly blamed gates for an  explosion  in the number of polio cases around the world  also read  misinformation about flu vaccine viral during covid    pandemic contacted by afp fact check  the who rejected both claims  who spokesman abdelhalim abdallah said the organisation  was not involved in any past nor ongoing cases of that sort    africa was declared free of wild poliovirus in august       landmark in decades long campaign to eradicate the disease   this historic public health achievement would have never been possible without maintaining vigilant polio disease surveillance and maintaining good vaccination coverage using the oral polio vaccine   abdallah said   anti vaccine activist afp fact check found various other claims about gates in an instagram post by prominent anti vaccine campaigner robert kennedy jr     who is also the nephew of former us president john f  kennedy   according to kennedy s multi slide post  indian doctors blame gates    whose eponymous foundation has pledged      million to buy eventual covid    vaccines for low income countries    for polio epidemic that  paralyzed         children between      and        however  as we explain in previous debunk  official statistics show only tiny number of cases in which the oral polio vaccine directly resulted in indian children contracting the disease   india was declared polio free in       three years after its last case of wild polio   there still exists version of the illness known as vaccine derived polio  which occurs in rare cases when the weakened virus in the vaccine mutates in areas with low vaccination coverage  according to the who  there were    cases of vaccine derived polio in india between      and       with    in      and two in       it s not the first time bill gates has been targeted by misinformation around polio  afp fact check has previously reported on social media posts accusing him of forcefully vaccinating africans against the disease or even plotting to kill them   also read  no  getting the flu vaccine does not lead to covid    india kicked out gates foundation   another claim made by kennedy    picked up by facebook posts here and here    is that the indian government  dialed back gates  vaccine regimen and evicted gates  from the country s national advisory board  which advises the prime minister on policy  in        as previously verified by afp fact check  the indian government rejected media reports in      suggesting that health related collaboration with the bill   melinda gates foundation had been stopped  the gates foundation  continues to collaborate and support the ministry of health and family welfare   the indian government said at the time  and in september       indian prime minister narenda modi said the gates foundation was doing  important work  in india   gates foundation forcibly vaccinated african children   kennedy s post also claims that the gates foundation forcibly vaccinated  thousands of african children against meningitis  and that  between    and     children developed paralysis  from the menafrivac vaccine  launched in       the meningitis vaccine    the first made specifically for use in africa    has been administered to more than     million people across the continent  the gates foundation has rejected these claims  contacted by afp fact check  spokesperson said that the foundation  does not itself deliver vaccines   they said organisations such as the who  unicef and local aid groups deliver vaccines  according to the us national institute of health s fogarty international centre  the menafrivac programme cut cases of meningitis from over         during an outbreak in      to just    confirmed cases in       afp fact check ran google search for the keywords  children paralysed menafrivac  and found report   communication challenges during the

paralysis    in news story that was promptly picked up by international media and anti vaccine activists   chadian authorities invited an international team of clinicians and epidemiologists to investigate the problem  an investigation proceeded  all cases were examined by physicians  who did not find cases of paralysis  and all of the affected individuals recovered without incident   the

findings that gradually improve   medical journal the lancet reviewed the vaccine administration in chad and concluded it was  highly effective   also read  no  africa is not being used as guniea pig to test the covid    vaccine gates funded research committed ethical violations in india  kennedy also claims that the gates foundation funded tests of experimental hpv vaccines on        girls in india committed ethical violations  and has case before the indian supreme court   afp fact check found that the gates foundation indeed funded hpv vaccine projects for developing countries  including india  in india  seven girls died during vaccine trials  as reported in the local media and by the academic journal science magazine  however  further study revealed that the girls  deaths were not vaccine related    five were evidently unrelated to the vaccine  one girl drowned in quarry  another died from snake bite  two committed suicide by ingesting pesticides  and one died from complications of malaria   science magazine reported  the cause of deaths for the two other girls was less certain  according to government investigators who traced all seven deaths  this was also reported by the lancet medical journal  the trials were halted  and the indian government set up committee to investigate  it concluded that there were some irregularities in the administration of the vaccines  it claimed that the gates funded programme for appropriate technology in health  path  opened an office in india  without getting the required mandatory approvals permissions  and  exploited with impunity the loopholes  in the indian system  path  the global health nonprofit in charge of the vaccination process  did not agree with the conclusions of the committee   path is committed to meeting the highest scientific  ethical  and legal standards   the nonprofit said   kennedy also claimed  indian government found gates funded researchers committed ethical violations  pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial  bullying parents  forging consent forms  and refusing medical care to the injured girls   the claims are exaggerated  the indian government reviewed the process and published its conclusions here  there are no records of bullying  pressuring village girls  or refusing medical care  the government  however  said the organisations in charge of the vaccinations violated some ethical standards  criticised in south africa  kennedy also claims that south african newspapers said  we are guinea pigs for drugmakers  and that south african geopolitics professor patrick bond called gates  ruthless  and  immoral   bond indeed criticised gates  methods in global philanthropy in      article  but afp fact check found no public record of him describing gates as ruthless or immoral  the times live in south africa did write an article to say south africans were used as guinea pigs by drugmakers  the newspaper was reporting an allegation by dutch ngo wemos  there was no mention of the gates foundation   gates raised polio vaccine doses to    per child  the instagram post further claims that gates took control of india s national advisory board  nab  and mandated     polio vaccines  up from    to every child before age five   this is misleading  the gates foundation did not mandate the use of    polio vaccine doses for children in india  according to the who  the use of fractional doses  which was introduced in india in       could raise the number of fractional doses in vial to       not the number of doses to be taken by child    when vial intended for full dose vaccination is used to deliver fractional doses  the number of doses it contains increases by factor of five  vial containing   or    full doses becomes     or    fractional dose vial  respectively   who said in one of its bulletins published in february       due to global shortage of inactivated poliovirus vaccine  who s strategic advisory group of experts on immunization    not the gates foundation    recommended that countries with good immunisation coverage consider administering fractional doses  as they have the resources to ensure the close

kenya s catholic doctors association accused the who in      of chemically sterilising  millions of unwilling kenyan women with phony  tetanus  vaccine campaign    these allegations are either false or taken out of context  in       the gates foundation indeed pledged     billion to increase vaccination rates among children  during ted talk in february that year  gates spoke about reducing global population growth by    or    percent thanks to new vaccines  improved healthcare and comprehensive reproductive health services  in       he recommended developing vaccines to reduce child mortality rates  he argued that increasing the chance of child surviving to adulthood and encouraging parents to have smaller families that would benefit from government resources would create  virtuous cycle  to take  country out of poverty    gates has said that having many children can be seen by parents as way to offset high child mortality  and that if they were sure their children would survive  they would have fewer children   the claim about sterilising kenyan women using tetanus vaccine has been dismissed by kenyan authorities and the who  the un health agency says the vaccine is safe   this claim has been extensively debunked by afp fact check here   malaria vaccine killed     africans   kennedy also claimed that the gates foundation funded trial in      of an experimental malaria vaccine by british pharmaceutical giant glaxosmithkline  the post says the drug killed     african infants and caused  serious adverse effects including paralysis  seizure  and febrile convulsions to       of the       children    while the malaria vaccine was being trialled between      and       the who said the known side effects  include pain and swelling at the injection site  and fever    it

said  the cells that the virus needs to reach in order to start an infection are along the inner lining of the lung and the inside of the intestine  and it is not clear how the virus could reach those cells or start an infection via the bloodstream  the cell is house and the virus spike protein  which binds to cells to allow infection  editors note  is like key that unlocks the front door  so the virus can enter via the lungs  he said Â  to enter the same cells via the bloodstream  the virus would effectively need to have key to the back door  and we don t know if this is the case  neuman explained that if it wereÂ transmittable through the blood  covid    would also be sexually transmittable disease  not only respiratory one Â  there are currently    candidate covid    vaccines in clinical evaluation  with handful tested in large studies involving thousands of people  during vaccination  patient is given harmless form of disease  which triggers an immune response to fight it  this means that if the same disease is encountered again  the immune system has memory of the disease and is ready to quickly destroy it before you get sick and any symptoms can develop  the british society for immunology says  shabir madhi  professor of vaccinology at the university of witwatersrand  johannesburg  and member of the world health organization  explained three ways the potential covid    vaccine would be administered and what it would requireÂ to be efficient Â  he told afp fact check that the first method uses weakened or inactivated sars cov   virus as the vaccine  the second one would involve nucleic acid based vaccines  which directly deliver genetic material coding for segment of protein only of the virus  lastly  he explained that there are vector based vaccines

sharks produce natural compound called squalene in their liver  which is commonly  but not always  used to create some vaccines  an estimate by the conservation group shark allies suggested that as many as         sharks may be harvested in order to create enough covid    vaccines to distribute globally  some vaccine candidates would require squalene  but how much is needed also depends on which vaccines move forward in clinical testing  shark allies did not claim         sharks would certainly be killed  the estimate had caveats  and may only come to fruition if researchers actually use shark squalene  which could either increase or decrease the number of sharks harvested to produce covid    vaccine  while known human population sizes can be used to estimate the number of sharks needed to manufacture vaccine  it is not likely that every person within population will need one  furthermore  synthetic alternatives to squalene exist that may prove more beneficial to the production of vaccine   while scientists around the world raced to find potential vaccine for covid     the respiratory disease caused by sars cov    misleading and misconstrued information continued to engulf the internet  among these rumors was the claim that coronavirus vaccine would result in the harvesting and death of as many as         wild sharks  the claim originated from non peer reviewed research conducted on behalf of shark allies  marine conservation advocacy group  that estimated the amount of squalene required to fulfill the demand of global vaccine  squalene is natural compound found in the livers of sharks  among many other species  including humans  and is commonly used to create some vaccines  while it is true that some covid    vaccine contenders in clinical trials in october      contained squalene  the         mark was at the high end of projected estimates and did not account for number of limitations and variables set forth in the research  in an email  shark allies founder and executive director stefanie brendl said that the reporting was big misunderstanding and was largely based on misleading headlines  we did not claim that vaccine companies or fishermen would go out to kill         sharks right now to fill the vaccine demand  brendl told snopes  that number  without the many caveats that came with the research  was published in the daily telegraph and subsequently picked up by several publications that reiterated the exaggerated claim  deep sea sharks located at depths up to       feet have large reserves of squalene to help maintain neutral buoyancy  as much as one quarter of their weight may be composed of squalene  compared to just    that of most mammals  according to report published by oceana  squalene is used as an adjuvant  particular ingredient used in vaccines to elicit stronger immune response to protect an individual from the disease  according to the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   applying an adjuvant to vaccine makes it so that less of particular virus is needed for production  squalene containing adjuvants  especially two known as mf   and as    have been increasingly employed as an immunologic adjuvant in several vaccines  including the novel influenza  h n        pandemic flu and fluad and chiron seasonal influenza vaccines since       in fact  more than    million doses of squalene containing flu vaccines have been administered globally  according to the world health organization  who   josh soll  campaign researcher for shark allies  told snopes that his research used previously prepared squalene quantities in adjuvants to estimate the sharks needed to fulfill covid    vaccine demands based on human populations  which could equate to more than half million sharks Â to come to his conclusion  soll said that he turned to published findings that determined the amount of shark squalene in some vaccine adjuvants  as well as information of approximately how many sharks are required to produce one metric ton of squalene  previous research that tested shark squalene based adjuvants for diseases such as influenza and past coronaviruses such as sars and mers provided information on the quantity of squalene that is used in single dose of an adjuvant  which is component of some vaccines  sol said  knowing roughly the amount of squalene needed to produce given vaccine  soll was able to estimate the approximate number of sharks that would be required either for single or double dose  per each person in the world Â  who noted that as   and mf    the two adjuvants most commonly made from shark squalene  require       and      milligrams of squalene per dose  respectively  based on these estimates  soll determined that between       and       sharks would be needed to produce   metric ton of squalene based adjuvant  with this information  soll estimated that one round of squalene based covid    vaccination given to the global human population would equate to the harvesting of approximately         and         sharks  but that doesnt account for variables and assumptions made by the research  not only is it unlikely that every person in the world will require covid    vaccine  but the exact dosage and administration schedule are not known  while it is true that the development and production of some vaccines  including future vaccinations against covid     may require squalene  the estimates are based on limited set of data  for starters  the estimate assumes that only squalene from sharks will be used rather than synthetic alternatives or squalene harvested from other sources  or that vaccine will require squalene in the first place  these estimates may only come to fruition if shark squalene based adjuvant is produced and needed for vaccines in the first place  noted shark allies  many covid    vaccines in the testing phase in october      did not use either an adjuvant or squalene  as of oct     some    candidate vaccines were in clinical evaluation and     in pre clinical evaluation  of these vaccines     used adjuvants and at least five were shark squalene based  according to data published by who  we have no idea how many more coronaviruses we will have to deal with in the years to come  that number also doesnt reflect how many years we will be given covid    vaccines  this is going to be the new normal  said brendl  noting that parsing out whether sharks are harvested only for their squalene or if there are other reasons will be nearly impossible  so  saying that         sharks will die only because of vaccine is tricky statement  she added  in late       the squalene market continued to grow and was expected to reach      million by       and as squalene demand increases  so does the need for its source  it is estimated that up to   million sharks are killed each year for their squalene  and brendl suspects that number could increase if squalene is used in

after    september  the government is going to say that because there were no objections  they will roll out unlicensed vaccines  unlicensed  rather than untested  vaccines are already allowed to be rolled out by the government in circumstances such as pandemic  the government is consulting on whether to clarify the rules around this  these unlicensed vaccines will be administered by non medical staff  such as your employer  the government is consulting the public on whether to change the rules around who can administer certain vaccines  which may include some people who dont normally administer them  including some who arent registered healthcare professionals  it does not specifically mention employers  the public wont be able to claim compensation if unlicensed vaccines damage our health  they will in some cases  if the product doesnt meet safety standards or is defective  then the manufacturer is liable    the consultation aside  its already true that if the government recommends the roll out of an unlicensed product  manufacturers cant usually be sued in civil court for the consequences  number of posts on facebook and twitter have used link to government consultation about vaccines to make number of unfounded claims about government changes to how vaccines are introduced in the uk  one such post reads  after   th sept  the government are going to say they consulted the public and because there were no objections  we all want and consent to the rollout of unlicensed  vaccines  and that we are happy for non medical staff to administer them and happy to accept we will not have the ability to ask for compensation if we face damage to our health  although there is genuine consultation happening on the subject of unlicensed vaccines  in general these claims are misleading  the government can already roll out unlicensed  but not untested  vaccines during public health emergency  and this consultation is proposing to clarify the rules around doing this  as we cant fact check what the government might do in future  here weve focussed on what the consultation document proposes doing  some of these posts imply that unlicensed vaccines are untested  which is not the case  an unlicensed vaccine for covid    or anything else  does not mean its not been tested  as weve written before  any vaccine rolled out to the public  unlicensed or not  still has to go through extensive clinical trials  this would include covid    vaccine  licensing happens after the vaccine has gone through all three phases of pre launch trials  which usually means the vaccine has already been tested on thousands of adults  licensing is when experts within the national medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency  or the eu regulators  up to the end of the transition period  review the results of the trials  the standards of vaccines generally have to be much higher than those for medication to treat illnesses  as vaccines are usually given to healthy people to prevent disease  the government is asking people to respond to its proposals to change certain aspects of the human medicines regulations       the proposed changes would make it easier for the government to roll out covid    vaccine to large number of people  faster than usual  there are five main proposed changes  regulation     of the human medicines regulations already allow the licensing authority to temporarily grant authorisation to an unlicensed medicinal product in the case of certain types of public health threat  such as pandemic  the government is not planning to change that regulation  but instead to provide transparency  we propose to amend the  human medicines regulations  to make it explicit that the supply of products  including covid    vaccines  which is temporarily authorised under regulation     may be subject to conditions  so the plan is to make the rules around fast tracking unlicensed vaccines stricter  not looser  the consultation goes on to say that covid    vaccine would only be authorised in this way if the licensing authority was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety  quality and efficacy of the vaccine  in the particular context in which the licensing authority was asked to take that decision  the government confirms that the decision to roll out vaccination programmes for unlicensed vaccines will be taken nationally  and not by individual companies  the consultation suggests clarifying some of the rules around who is liable for potential problems around unlicensed medicines Â  the government consultation document states that the law does not provide complete immunity from civil liability  and if the product is not found to meet safety standards or is defective  then the company will be liable Â  however  its already true that manufacturers cannot generally be sued in the civil courts for the consequences resulting from the use of an unlicensed product  or new use of licensed product  that national licensing authority is recommending in order to deal with certain specific health threats  according to government consultation document Â  weve written an entire piece on this issue  which you can read here  at the moment  only doctors and other qualified prescribers can normally authorise the administration of unlicensed vaccines  the consultation proposes making administering unlicensed vaccines easier for people like midwives  nursing associates  operating department practitioners  paramedics  physiotherapists and pharmacists  and some others in related fields  who arent normally allowed to administer products without full marketing authorisation such as dieticians or radiographers Â  the consultation also recommends allowing people who are not registered healthcare professionals  to safely administer licensed or temporarily authorised covid    or influenza vaccine  which seems to be what the facebook posts are referring to  the consultation does not specifically mention employers  the government adds  any additional workforce operating under the national protocol to administer vaccines will be trained and shown to be competent via an nhs and phe approved training programme to ensure patient safety  the consultation document also recommends allowing temporarily authorised products  such as future covid    vaccine  to be advertised to the public and healthcare professionals  currently  the promotion of any unlicensed medical products is banned  the government also proposes simplifying the rules around how vaccine supplies are moved between service providers  to allow any problems with supply between organisations to be swiftly solved  the consultation says these measures would be temporary  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as missing context                 because although the government has put out consultation on unlicensed vaccines  that does not mean the vaccines have not been fully tested  and people would be able to get compensation in some circumstances  for example if the vaccine didnt meet safety standards,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

news moderator george stephanopoulos asked the president to clarify if he believes the virus will go away without vaccine  mr  trump responded   sure  over period of time    mr  trump said in february that the    coronavirus cases in the u s  would soon be  zero   he s also said repeatedly that the virus will eventually disappear  without citing evidence Â   but public medical experts think this strain of coronavirus may be here to stay Â    absent vaccine  i think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with   bill hanage  an associate professor of epidemiology at harvard university s school of public health  told usa today earlier this year   it is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory virai infections    new review in  frontiers in public health  says covid    will likely become seasonal eventually  Â   mr  trump  who has not followed through on pledge in july that he would have health care plan ready and signed in two weeks  said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the affordable care act  he was responding to ellesia blaque  an assistant professor who lives in philadelphia  who told him she s paying        year for life saving medicine because of condition she was born with  sarcoidosis Â    that disease started in my skin  moved to my eyes  into my optic nerves  and when i went to graduate school  into my brain   she said    i want to know what it is that you re going to do assure that people like me who work hard  we do everything we re supposed to do  can stay insured   she asked mr  trump    so first of all  you are taken seriously  i hope you are   he responded   and we are not going to hurt anything having to do with preexisting conditions  we re not going to hurt preexisting conditions  and  in fact  just the opposite    but while the president has claimed he would protect preexisting conditions  his administration has been trying to kill the affordable care act in the courts   in june  the trump administrationÂ asked the supreme courtÂ to overturn obamacare  arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so  the rest of the law  which includes preexisting condition protections  should be struck down Â   when stephanopoulos pointed this out to the president  mr  trump responded   doesn t matter  i have it already  and it s much better plan for you  and it s much better plan  Â   while he said he has the plan  already   stephanopoulos noted that mr  trump has been in office for       years and has not yet presented plan to replace obamacare Â   mr  trump said this summer that he was working on an executive order to protect those with preexisting conditions Â   it s still unclear when that health care plan  which mr  trump said would be signed weeks ago  will be released  white house chief of staffÂ mark meadows said the plan has legislative component and an executive action component Â   mr  trump also claimed  herd mentality  will help rid the u s  of the virus Â    and you ll develop  you ll develop herd  like herd mentality  it s going to be herd developed  and that s going to happen   the president said tuesday night   that will all happen  but with vaccine i think it will go away very quickly  but i really believe we re rounding the corner  and i believe that strongly    stephanopoulos pointed out that dr  anthony fauci disagrees with this  but mr  trump insisted other doctors like scott atlas agree with him Â   the reality of herd immunity  which appears to be what the president meant by  herd mentality   is not so clear  the scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection  which seem to make it possible to be reinfected Â   the herd immunity strategy would also yield far more deaths  as stephanopoulos pointed out Â   the president claimed he in fact  up played  covid     after telling washington post journalist bob woodwardÂ he  always wanted to play it down  Â    i didn t downplay it  i actually in many ways up played it in action   the president told the voter who asked him why he would  downplay pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low income families and minority communities    the president has long cited his move to restrict travel from china as one of those actions  but the president was also slower on other needed measures Â   for weeks  reporters pressed him on using the defense production act to ramp up production of much needed medical supplies before the president took action  he also claimed the virus would go from    cases down to  zero  quickly  and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear  he has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of covid      mr  trump  who typically forgoes wearing mask himself  said there are  lot of people  who think that  masks are not good   voter had asked why he doesn t wear mask more often himself and why he hasn t imposed national mask mandate    now there is  by the way  lot of people don t want to wear masks   he said   there are lot of people think the masks are not good  and there are lot of people that as an example    asked who those people are  the president responded that masks aren t good for  waiters    but mask wearing has proven to decrease the likelihood of transmission of covid     centers for disease control director robert redfield went as far to suggest in congressional testimony wednesday that masks might be more effective in fighting the virus than vaccine for some americans Â   the cdc says masks are  most likely to reduce the spread of covid    when they are widely used by people in public settings  Â    i might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when i take covid vaccine   redfield said wednesday     if i don t get an immune response  the vaccine s not going to protect me  this face mask will    mr  trump also said tuesday night that biden has agreed to bernie sanders style health care plan   if you look at what they  democrats  want to do  where they have socialized medicine  they will get rid of pre existing conditions    while biden and sanders did release platform to ensure  universal health care   it is not sanders   medicare for all  plan  the platform recommends an affordable and government run public option health care plan to be made available through the obamacare exchanges Â   biden s own proposal calls for building on the affordable care act and for increasing the value of tax credits to lower premiums for americans  biden s plan would also offer coverage premium free to individuals who would qualify under medicaid expansion  but whose states have chosen not to expand medicaid Â   bet notedÂ that the uncommitted african americans who asked mr  trump questions at the philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on range of topics from health care to inequality  blaque  the voter suffering from sarcoidosis  told cnn later that the president did not answer her question  and she s now decided who s getting her vote    i m going to vote for biden   she said,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]

if an unlicensed covid    vaccine is rushed into use by the british government  then the vaccines manufacturers would be exempt from civil liability  this is generally correct  eu law  which has been adopted by the uk  protects manufacturers from liability if the government decides to supply their vaccines without licensing  however  they are not exempt from all liabilities  facebook post has drawn attention to an extract from sun article  which states that manufacturers of potential fast tracked covid    vaccine would be protected from civil liability if the vaccine is later found to cause harm  this is mostly true Â  uk law does not usually allow the sale or supply of medicinal products  including vaccines  without marketing authorisation  product licensing  Â  however  this doesnt apply when the sale or supply of medicinal product is temporarily authorised in response to pathogenic agents such as the virus which causes covid    Â  so the government could authorise the supply of an unlicensed covid    vaccine  although  to be clear  unlicensed does not mean untested  any covid    vaccine rolled out to the public  unlicensed or not  will still go through clinical trials  licensing usually takes place after vaccine has undergone various trials and can typically take weeks or even months  any decision to fast track unlicensed vaccines would be decision made nationally and not by individual suppliers  manufacturers cannot generally be sued in the civil courts for the consequences resulting from the use of an unlicensed product  or new use of licensed product  that national licensing authority is recommending in order to deal with certain specific health threats  according to government consultation document Â  this is part of eu law which has been implemented into uk law  however  the government consultation document also states that the law does not provide complete immunity from civil liability  if the product is not found to meet safety standards or is defective  then there is liability Â  one of the scientists working on potential vaccine has stated that  while processes have been sped up  this doesnt mean steps to ensure safety have been missed  further guidance around what breach of these standards would mean  or how it would be assessed is currently being consulted on Â Â  it has also been recently reported that at least one potential covid    vaccine manufacturer  astrazeneca  has been exempted from future product liability claims with most of the countries it has supply agreements with  the article states it is not clear which specific countries this is  but it does have supply agreement with britain  this article is part of our work fact checking potentially false pictures  videos and stories on facebook  you can read more about thisand find out how to report facebook contenthere               for the purposes of that scheme  weve rated this claim as true                 because there is legal framework to potentially protect manufacturers of an unlicensed covid    vaccine if the government chose to roll it out,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

north dakota is going to inject natives first  claims an august          post  continuing  the governor of nd has just signed deal for the cdc to come inject those on standing rock and other indian tribes in nd with this deadly vaccine first Â  the north dakota department of health announced on august    that the state was one of four selected by the cdc to participate in covid    pilot project planning for vaccine distribution  in the first paragraph  the statement says  this is not vaccine trial Â  the cdc is interested in learning from tribal entities to explore strategies to reach american indian populations and help determine opportunities as it relates to vaccine planning and distribution  all five tribal entities and the nd indian affairs commission are invited to participate in the planning process  native americans have been among the hardest hit by novel coronavirus in the united states  scott davis  executive director of the north dakota indian affairs commission  said in video interview with local news  theres been lot of misinformation out here on this  lot of  ill just say  terrible social media posting  the idea that the state is going to force covid    vaccine on native american tribes is totally  totally false  he continued  although he said he understands existing mistrust of the us government because of past experience  at the end of the day  the tribes are gonna have their own processes  their own internal review boards to review  verify if this vaccine is proven  if its the right vaccine  theyre gonna administer their vaccine how they see fit  anthony fauci  the united states  top infectious diseases official  said on august    that the government wouldn t make any future covid    vaccine obligatory for the general public    though local jurisdictions could make it mandatory for some groups  like children who attend public schools   you don t want to mandate and try and force anyone to take vaccine  we ve never done that

service  explained  the program has nothing to do with clinical trials or mandating vaccines for anyone  in reality  it s more like theoretical supply chain exercise from what i understand  there are many potential covid    vaccines in different stages of testing  among them the moderna and pfizer   biontech shots  both of which involve mrna  both facebook posts list several other falsehoods about the vaccine which they mislabel as mtrna  they also call the shot deadly and claim that it alters human dna  the facebook posts claim  mtrna vaccine type has never before been authorized for human use this specific covid mtrna vaccine has not gone through any animal trials in violation of fda regulations and federal lawthis vaccine literally targets   alters the dna we receive from our mothers Â  dr shelley payne  director of the lamontagne center for infectious disease at the university of texas at austin  told afp in an email  there appears to be misunderstanding of what the vaccine is  the rna vaccine is mrna  messenger rna   not mtrna  mt   mitochondrial  Â  payne explained that mrna contains the information needed for cells to make proteins  and the mrna covid    vaccine directs cells to make stable form of the virus protein  the cells then read the mrna  make the protein and present it to the immune system  so the body can develop an immune response  she also clarified  mrna does not alter the dna  it doesnt get into the nucleus or the mitochondria so it doesnt interact with either the nuclear or the mitochondrial dna  the vaccines in human trials are not deadly  she continued  because of the need for rapid development  some of the vaccines did not go through the long term  large scale animal tests for efficacy  i e  how well the vaccine protects  but they were tested in animals for safety vaccine that killed animals or had serious side effects in the phase   and   studies would not be used  afp fact check previously debunked false claims about vaccine safety amid the accelerated timeline for development of covid    immunization  the moderna rna vaccine that i assume the facebook post was talking about is novel approach that has never been used before as human vaccine  said dr julian leibowitz  an expert in coronaviruses who is professor of microbial pathogenesis and immunology at texas ms college of medicine  but he told afp via email that  following phase one and two trials it was judged entirely safe with no significant adverse events  adding  there is no evidence that it affects the recipients dna at all and no mechanism that i can think of that

source  facebook user  facebook     aug       Â      review   misleading claim circulating on facebook in august      questions whether vaccine against sars cov    the virus that causes covid     would be useful because the survival rate  of covid    is  close to      without vaccine  this claim is misleading because it suggests that vaccines are only useful for preventing diseases with low survival rates  the claim disregards factors besides average survival rate that are critical for evaluating the usefulness of vaccine  disease survival rate alone is not sufficient for determining whether development of vaccine would be useful because it overlooks the fact that the more people who become infected in the first place  the more who will die from the disease  virus transmissibility is therefore an important factor to consider because it directly impacts the total number of individuals who may become infected  for instance  an extremely deadly virus with low transmissibility could end up killing fewer people than less deadly virus that infects the entire world population  current estimates of the infection fatality ratio  ifr  of covid     which is the number of deaths that have occurred among all people infected with sars cov    are between      and              while an ifr of      can be interpreted as survival rate close to       it still means that out of       infections    people could die  in other words  if the entire u s  population of     million people became infected  an estimated     million would be expected to die  sars cov   has spread rapidly throughout the world  infecting nearly    million people to date  because it is transmitted through respiratory droplets from person to person  in addition  because sars cov   is new to the human population  people have little or no preexisting immunity to the virus  these factors influence the basic reproduction number  r    which is the average number of people that an already infected individual will typically infect  this number provides insight into the potential transmissibility of the virus  the reproduction number of virus is difficult to determine as it is strongly influenced by multiple factors  including local population density  cultural practices  air temperature  and humidity  nature news article reported that estimates for the r  of sars cov   range from   to      many other diseases have r s that fall within this range  including the      spanish flu       tuberculosis  and ebola  all of which have existing vaccines or vaccines in development  for comparison  sars cov   is more contagious than the      swine flu  r  of     to         and less contagious than smallpox    to    and measles     to      despite the low ifr of covid     the widespread prevalence and high transmissibility of sars cov   has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide and made it one of the leading causes of death in       this is illustrated by the unusually high number of excess deaths recorded in the u s  in      compared to the average number of deaths in previous years  as health feedback previously reported  the claim suggests that the average survival rate from covid    is the deciding factor when determining the usefulness of vaccine  however  diseases can also cause severe  long term or permanent conditions  albeit not immediately life threatening  for example  polio can cause permanent paralysis even if patient survives  in the case of covid     an april      news article in science detailed how sars cov   damages variety of tissues in the body  both directly and indirectly  due to inflammation     indeed  growing number of reports indicate that covid    can produce diverse list of symptoms  some of which can significantly impair patients recovery and impact quality of life  the mayo clinic lists heart failure  difficulty breathing  and risks of neurological disorders    among them  researchers from swansea university have also warned of potential long lasting effects of infection  including lung damage  therefore  sars cov   infection does not need to be deadly in order to severely jeopardize persons health and quality of life  an effective vaccine could protect people from suffering potentially debilitating damage from covid     finally  the claim that the survival rate  is  close to      is an average  and therefore overlooks the fact that the survival rate for covid    is much lower for older individuals and people with pre existing medical conditions  such as obesity  chronic kidney disease  or hypertension  the cdc reports that the mortality rate for covid    is at least    times higher for people older than    years than it is for people between    and    years old  for example  study estimated the average ifr in china to be        but the ifr among people more than    years old was three times higher     based on this data  covid    is much deadlier for some segments of the population than others  vaccine could not only directly benefit the people who get it  but could also indirectly protect more vulnerable individuals in population by helping to achieve herd immunity  in summary  the claim questions whether vaccine for sars cov   would be useful based on the sole consideration that the survival rate of covid    is close to       such reasoning is misleading as it does not take into account three important factors that make vaccine suitable strategy  first  disease with high survival rate can still cause large number of deaths in population  and this number increases with the proportion of the population that becomes infected  second  death is not the only important outcome associated with diseases that can be prevented by vaccines  vaccines also reduce the incidence of long term damage and delayed recovery  third  the average survival rate does not capture the fact that certain segments of the population  such as the elderly  are more vulnerable to the disease than others  hence  widespread vaccination of the population would also help protect vulnerable segments of the population from potentially deadly infection by helping to achieve herd immunity    coronavirus Â covid    Â vaccine,[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

bombshell as flu shots found to cause huge increases in coronavirus infections   says the headline of an article shared as screenshot on july          on facebook      children who are vaccinated with flu shots have     percent increase in risk of contradicting other respiratory infections such as coronavirus  researchers found in published paper   claims the post  which also circulated on

pandemic from retired pediatrician      also read  dr anthony fauci falsely linked to      study on hcq and coronaviruses bmj executive editor theodora bloom explained in an email that  rapid responses  are comments to the editors that appear on the journal s website but  are not indexed in pubmed and they are not journal articles     although we moderate rapid responses to ensure they are not libellous  for example  they are certainly not endorsed by the publication   she said  another version of the post reveals that the source of the claim is an article on the website naturalnews

noninfluenza respiratory virus infections associated with receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine    the study was conducted from            decade before the novel coronavirus pandemic  and only included     children during one flu season  it found that over nine months  the children in the group that received trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine  had an increased risk of virologically confirmed non influenza infections   ward explained that the study  though published in clinical infectious diseases  has methodological flaws  including having     times more children in the flu vaccine group  compared to the placebo group  sarah gilbert  professor of vaccinology at the university of oxford s nuffield department of medicine  also said in an email that it is important not to overstate the findings of small study   gilbert further explained   it isn t that the flu shot directly made children more susceptible to other viruses   she said the children in the placebo group who were not vaccinated were more likely to get the flu and there seemed to be short term protection from other viruses right after recovering from the flu  based on this study   no one should make decisions to avoid flu vaccinations   gilbert said  also read  social media posts falsely claim viruses do not harm or kill people flu shot and coronavirus risk danuta skowronski  the principal

monitor how well the influenza vaccine protects   asked if there was any particular coronavirus risk to children who receive the flu shot  skowronski said   we saw no association in children nor in adults between the receipt of influenza vaccine and coronavirus risk   similarly       study conducted in the us state of wisconsin covering six flu seasons and including more than       patients found   influenza vaccination was not associated with detection of noninfluenza respiratory viruses   claims that      study also found the flu shot left people vulnerable to infections were also

facebook post claims the recovery rate from covid    is      per cent  and claims there is choice between getting the disease and getting the vaccine with an    per cent adverse reaction rate  it also claims the vaccine killed five people during human trials  the post presents the supposed choice as predicament  the july    post has been viewed more than        times and shared more than     times  this facebook post misrepresents the covid    recovery rate as being      per cent  it is not  and makes false and misleading claims about vaccine that is not even available  including the unsubstantiated claim that people died during testing  while the post doesnt mention specific vaccine  the original poster subsequently refers in comments to the moderna rna vaccine  saying it has an     adverse reaction rate and has killed   people so far in the trials  biotech lab moderna is working with the us national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  niaid  on covid    vaccine  the moderna rna vaccine is among more than    currently being trialled around the world  and is one of the few that has alreadyÂ begun its last stage of testing  moderna reported in first phase trials of its mrna      vaccine   that no trial limiting safety concerns were identified  as reported in the new england journal of medicine  theÂ u s department of health and human services concluded that in terms of safety  there were no serious adverse events reported  following the trial  moderna said in statement on july    that mrna      was generally safe and well tolerated  with no serious adverse events reported over the eight week period of the trial  the statement noted that systemic adverse events  which relates to effects that occur away from the injection site  were more common after the second of two shots of the vaccine  which was administered to three groups at three different doses    micrograms  mcg       mcg and    mcg  it said the most common adverse reaction after the second shot for recipients of the    mcg dose were fatigue        chills        headache       and myalgia        all of which were transient and mild or moderate in severity  the    percent for fatigue and chills appears to be where the facebook post sourced its     figure  however the suggestion that anyone could get the vaccine with its     adverse reaction rate is completely misleading  the percentage relates to results in some recipients in an early stage clinical trial of vaccine  no vaccine has reached final production and no vaccine is available for anyone to get  the phase three trial of the moderna vaccine  involving up to        participants  only began on july    and is not due to be completed until october           professor of respiratory medicine at the university of

covid     Â produced by the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center  shows the average mortality rate of all countries combined is roughly Â three  four per cent  assuming everyone who doesnt die recovers  then the recovery rate cant be more than    or    per cent  professor marks told aap factcheck  but the other part to this is there is increasing evidence some people who have had covid Â have persistent symptoms and persisting abnormalities  and as yet we dont know how long that will last  for many diseases there are long term consequences which mean that not having died is not the same as recovering  aap factcheck has previously examined claims that covid    has      per cent or higher survival rate and also found them false  professor marks said the claim about the vaccine adverse reaction rate of    per cent was false  there are no vaccines for which    per cent of people get adverse effects that i am aware of in use  he said  the only identified source of the claim that five people died from vaccine trial is an unsubstantiated story that appears on low profile news website in the lugansk peoples republic  pro russian independent state in ukraine  news site lugansk media centre published this article on july    claiming that five people  including four ukranian army members  died after being exposed to the vaccine and medication produced by americal  sic

incorrect to claim covid    has      per cent recovery rate as statistics do not back that claim  it is false to claim there is any vaccine available that has an    per cent adverse reaction rate and

review   facebook posts  example  asking the question would you take vaccine with     death rate to feel safe from virus with       death rate  began circulating in late july       and have received more than        interactions on facebook  according to the social media analytics tool crowdtangle  the identity of the virus and the vaccine are not explicitly stated in the post  but it most likely refers to the virus sars cov   and the covid    vaccine  the question posed in the post introduces the false premise that covid    vaccine has been developed and found to cause death in     of people who receive it  although the facebook posts do not provide any information about the source of this figure  it is most likely based on recent false claim that five of    test subjects died in clinical trial conducted in ukraine which tested covid    vaccine supposedly developed in the u s  the claim  which was attributed to the lugansk media centre  example  and the lugansk peoples republic  was debunked in fact checks published by vox ukraine and afp fact check  lugansk is city in eastern ukraine which is involved in territorial dispute between ukraine and russia  the claim was also published by news front  an outlet known for publishing pro russia disinformation  according to politifact  politifact reported finding no record of covid    vaccine trial taking place in ukraine in clinicaltrials gov  database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies conducted around the world  which is run by the u s  national library of medicine  similarly  the isrctn registry  clinical trial registry recognized by the world health organization and the international committee of medical journal editors  contains no record of any such study  vox ukraine also stated  there is

ukrainian military has also refuted the claim  with spokesperson oleksiy mazepa confirming  there are no tests with our soldiers  this is obvious fake news  this is the way russian propaganda works  the involvement of the lugansk media centre and the lugansk peoples republic in the propagation of this claim suggests that it may have originated as part of russian disinformation campaign  outlets with links to the russian government have had track record of promoting misinformation about vaccines and covid     among other topics  euvsdisinfo  project of the european external active services eaststratcom task force  which addresses russian disinformation campaigns  has documented these ongoing campaigns here and here  in      study published in the american journal of public health  researchers from the george washington university who studied more than     million tweets found that russian trolls and bots contributed to online vaccine misinformation by promoting discord and false equivalency  fostering the appearance of genuine public debate over vaccines  and driving vaccine hesitancy     as of   august       more than     covid    vaccine candidates are in development around the world  according to the new york times coronavirus vaccine tracker  vaccine remains the only way to achieve herd immunity safely  as carl bergstrom  biologist at the university of washington  and natalie dean  biostatistician at the university of florida  state in new york times opinion piece  it is challenging to determine the exact percentage of immune individuals needed to achieve herd immunity to covid    in population because the number depends on many biological and social variables  as marm kilpatrick  an epidemiologist and professor at university of california santa cruz  explains in this twitter thread  one study published in science used mathematical model that considered variations in human behavior to estimate that herd immunity would be reached when     of population was immune to the disease     in contrast  an article published in immunity estimated that approximately     of the population needs to be immune     however  this estimate is based on the model of classical herd immunity  and the authors cautioned that this model relies on simplifying assumptions  such as homogeneous population mixing and uniform sterilizing immunity in recovered individuals across demographic groups  which are unlikely to hold true  in real life   although there is pressure to develop covid    vaccine quickly  scientists emphasize that vaccine safety must remain top priority  you really have to test vaccine carefully  and not just roll it out because people are clamoring for it with an epidemic underway  said marc lipsitch  an epidemiologist at the harvard chan school of public health  in pnas news article published    march       shibo jiang  virologist at fudan university  also warned of significant repercussions if vaccines and therapies reach the market before adequate safety testing  the publics willingness to back quarantines and other public health measures to slow spread tends to correlate with how much people trust the governments health advice  rush into potentially risky vaccines and therapies will betray that trust and discourage work to develop better assessments  he wrote in nature article  vaccine candidates  including those for covid     must pass several stages of clinical trials that demonstrate their safety and efficacy before they are approved for public use in the u s   see figure below   the u k   australia  the european union  and other parts of the world  covid    vaccine that kills one in three people would not pass clinical trials or be licensed by health authorities  as this would be considered an unacceptably high risk of serious adverse effects  overall  the claim that covid    vaccine has     death rate is false and unsupported by scientific evidence  it is likely based on separate claim  which was refuted by multiple sources  although it remains unclear which  if any  of the covid    vaccine candidates currently undergoing testing will ultimately be licensed for public use  there has been surge of misinformation about covid    vaccines on social media  health feedback reviewed some of these claims  including the false claims that rna vaccines alter our dna and that volunteer died during vaccine trial in april  the proliferation of such misinformation has left its mark  according to an article published in science on    june  as few as     of americans plan to get covid    vaccine  while in france more than     said they would not get vaccine  in the united kingdom  about     of people surveyed said they would refuse vaccine and another     said they were

review   facebook post published at the end of july      expressed skepticism at how we could make vaccine in   months for an illness that  we  still dont understandheavily implied to be covid   by claiming that we cant make vaccine that works for influenza and cant cure cancer  posts resharing this message have been circulating in facebook groups  including those which oppose vaccination and promote conspiracy theories  receiving more than       interactions on facebook in just over week according to crowdtangle  as this review explains below  the post relies on mix of inaccurate information and flawed reasoning to question the possibility of developing covid    vaccine within six months  it is not clear based on what evidence the post asserts that scientists are sure to perform this feat in six months  which is an extremely short timeline  in fact  the general scientific consensus is that vaccine would likely take at least year to develop  if not more  the post also makes reference to drinking the kool aid  implying that scientists working to develop covid    vaccine are attempting to hoodwink and harm the general public  although the post does not explain what motive scientists would have for doing so  the blanket statement that we have no vaccine that works for influenza is inaccurate  studies have shown that the flu vaccine can reduce the incidence and severity of flu       this was also the conclusion of previous health feedback review regarding the efficacy of the flu shot in the elderly  however  it is true that compared to other vaccines like the measles vaccine  which has about     effectiveness with one dose and     with two doses  the flu vaccine is not as effective  furthermore  the effectiveness of the flu vaccine fluctuates from season to season  based on data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention  cdc   vaccine effectiveness over the past    flu seasons ranged from    to      vaccine effectiveness is determined by the strains of inactivated flu viruses which are included in the shot  which may differ from season to season  depending on factors like genetic changes in the circulating flu viruses  the selection of flu vaccine strains is based on recommendations made by scientists using data from flu surveillance laboratories around the world  in order to understand which flu strains are circulating and causing illness  the recommendations are then issued by the who  although the health authority for each country makes the final decision regarding which flu strains are included in the vaccines licensed for their country  in the case of the u s   this decision is made by the cdc  there are instances where strain predictions for particular flu season turned out to be mismatch  which likely led the effectiveness of the flu vaccine to be lower than expected  however  even mismatched flu vaccine can provide partial protection against the flu  the posts implication that the vaccine does not work because it does not produce perfect results is an example of the nirvana fallacy  in which realistic solution to problem is dismissed simply because it does not achieve an impossible ideal  rsv is one of the viruses responsible for the common cold  it usually produces mild illness in older children and adults  but like the flu  certain parts of the population  such as very young children and the elderly  are at higher risk of complications like pneumonia  according to the cdc  over        hospitalizations          emergency department visits and     million outpatient clinic visits among children    years of age are attributed to respiratory syncytial virus  rsv  infections each year in the united states  rsv associated deaths among children    years of age are thought to be uncommon  estimated at         per year  among us adults  an estimated         hospitalizations and        deaths associated with rsv infections occur annually  however  these are likely underestimates of rsv associated deaths  it is true that no vaccine for rsv exists yet  although synthetic antibody called palivizumab can be used to prevent rsv infection in high risk infants  prophylaxis   such as those who were born prematurely or with heart conditions  however  its effects are short lived and it cannot be used to treat an infection that has already begun  patients with rsv infection receive mainly supportive care  as there is lack of effective drugs for treating the infection  overall  given the lack of effective therapies for the disease  developing vaccine to prevent rsv infection  especially in at risk populations  remains an important goal  some vaccine candidates against rsv are now in clinical trials     safety considerations are paramountin       young children who had received an inactivated rsv vaccine in the u s  developed more severe illness upon infection with rsv compared to unvaccinated children  however  based on new developments in immunology and additional studies  scientists were able to uncover the mechanism behind the enhanced disease severity induced by the vaccine     this knowledge will enable scientists to work towards designing safer rsv vaccine candidates     broadly speaking  cancer is simply the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cells as result of gene mutations  however  there are many different mechanisms which underpin this overgrowth     which result from different combinations of genetic mutations that vary from person to person  this means that cancer is essentially family of different diseases rather than single disease  some of which are more aggressive and difficult to treat  while there is no universal cure for cancerand we are very unlikely to find one  as previous health feedback review explainedthere are treatments available  including chemotherapy  radiotherapy  surgery  and immunotherapy  although anticancer therapy has varying degrees of success  depending on factors like the type of cancer and how advanced the disease is at the time of treatment  for instance  acute lymphoblastic leukemia  type of blood cancer affecting white blood cells called lymphocytes  is the most common childhood cancer  but about     of children are cured with treatment  on the other hand  glioblastoma multiforme  type of brain cancer  is much more dangerous  according to the national organization for rare diseases  the average survival time for patients with glioblastoma who have undergone combination treatments of surgery  chemotherapy  and radiotherapy is      months  in short  the post is inaccurate  as it oversimplifies cancer by characterizing it as single disease and it does not acknowledge that the outcome of treatment for different types of cancer can be highly variable  finally  treatment can produce complete  lifelong remission in some patients depending on the type of cancer  and such patients are effectively considered to be cured  covid    remains mystery to scientists  ranging from how the causal agent sars cov   evolved to how it can be treated and prevented in humans  however  scientists have demonstrated that previous work in related coronaviruses      such as sars cov       and mers cov      can give us headstart on developing potential covid    vaccine  contrary to the implied claim  we do not need to know everything or even lot about disease in order to treat or prevent it  the basic principle of vaccination is to expose person to an agent  such as protein from particular pathogen  that can induce immunity against pathogen  but does not itself cause the disease  in fact  society had been aware of this concept long before immunology became field of study  as illustrated by the work of english physician edward jenner in the late     s  who successfully vaccinated child against smallpox by inoculating him with cowpox material  furthermore  at the time that jenner performed his experiments in vaccination  germ theorythe accepted scientific theory that microorganisms can cause diseasehad not been formulated and jenner did not know that smallpox was caused by virus  germ theory was primarily formulated only in the late     s by scientists  among whom were louis pasteur and robert koch  in summary  while much about covid    and the virus sars cov   still eludes us  we do have an understanding of how to induce immunity against pathogen  thanks to the decades of research in microbiology and immunology  which can be applied to new pathogens  hence the post places an unwarranted amount of necessity in understanding disease fully in order to develop vaccine or treatment  while there is no doubt that having more knowledge about disease is helpful in developing treatment and prevention strategies  incomplete knowledge is not in itself an insurmountable obstacle    cancer Â coronavirus Â covid    Â flu Â influenza Â vaccine   published on     aug,[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]

as researchers worldwide work to develop vaccine for covid     social media post is claiming vaccine has already been developed and will cause widespread infertility  the post  on an australian anti vaccination facebook page called no jab no pay no way  freedom of choice  features meme claiming whistleblower from glaxosmithkline  gsk   uk headquartered multinational pharmaceutical company  said antigens in an upcoming vaccine are proven to cause infertility in up to     of recipients  text accompanying the post claims the corona vaccine is planned for population reduction and links to video on segment of the david knight show  talk show on the us right wing infowars website  in the video man makes series of claims about the bill and melinda gates foundation and what he says is information from whistleblower in gsk  the central claim is that covid    vaccine already exists and contains chemicals that cause infertility  the post has been shared more than     times since it was posted on june           the same meme or claims based on the video have appeared on other pages and platforms including here  here and here  the facebook post claims an unidentified uk glaxosmithkline whistleblower revealed the upcoming covid vaccine will contain antigens that cause infertility  the video  created by an individual introduced as zed phoenix  and later named as ben fellows  makes series of claims  including that gsk insider delivered information that covid    vaccine had already been made  in the video the speaker says he wants to look at who is running the vaccine trial and names dr andrew preston from the university of bath  saying he spoke on television the other night  phoenix says dr preston received     million grant from the bill and melinda gates foundation  which he claims is interfering and trying to manipulate human vaccine trials  there is no record of dr preston leading trial of covid    vaccine  the trial of covid    vaccine in the uk has been run by team at oxford university  dr preston has been in the media talking about vaccine development but as commentator  there is no evidence that dr preston received     million grant from the bill and melinda gates foundation  the    million figure may be drawn from an international whooping cough vaccine research project in which dr preston and bath university are among    organisations involved  that project received    million euro grant     million of which came from the european commission and the european federation of pharmaceutical industries and associations  with   million Â from the bill and melinda gates foundation  the video describes the claims as coming from an alleged gsk insider who believes that certain antigens are going to appear in the vaccine   m  s   the speaker says  were one foot in this and one foot out but im going to go through this and im going to present it as though its the truth  because i believe it is  Â   m  s  reading from unidentified documents  the speaker says   m  s  there is going to be an anti hcg antigen  now this is  hcg is something for  um  causes sterility in women  it is also combined with hcg and olh and    amino acid carboxy terminal peptides  the principle of anti hcg vaccine is to introduce antibodies which can bind to hcg and render it biologically inactive  the statement that hcg causes sterility is incorrect  hcg is hormone secreted during pregnancy  the remainder of the statement matches almost verbatim part of an unrelated     year old review of anti fertility vaccine research from the national institute of immunology in new delhi  india  other parts read from the documents also match the      review paper  including  gnrh resulted in decreased testicular size  drop of testosterone levels  and marked atrophy of the prostate   m  s  and sperm specific mitochondrial antigen  produced an antibody response in baboons and reduced fertility in the females    m  s  the speaker also says that gsk tested    women with vaccine containing anti hgc antigens that resulted in    becoming infertile   m  s   those statistics also appear in the      paper and an older one  by one of the same researchers and are not related to gsk  university of queensland infectious diseases physician and microbiologist associate professor paul griffin told aap factcheck the argument advanced in the video is fundamentally flawed  prof griffin said the      paper referred to in the video was obviously very deliberately about vaccine for contraception or cancer research  they picked together few unrelated concepts in an implausible way to try and mount an argument  suggesting that covid vaccine was going to leave people infertile  theres just nothing to substantiate that  prof griffin said  vaccine ingredients are freely available  highly transparent and these days  the way we make vaccines is so specific  based on such good technology  that the prospect of vaccine having collateral effects such as this is just not realistic  the speaker also says in the video that there are separate vaccines for males and females  prof griffin dismissed the suggestion  saying there is no difference for males and females for the effectiveness of covid    vaccine  for something that we want an immunological response to protect from pathogen  theres no sex difference based on that  so theres no suggestion were going to have male and female covid vaccine  he said  based on the evidence  aap factcheck found the facebook post to be false  the video refers to the claimed source as an alleged whistleblower  the speaker says he is one foot in this and one foot out on the material but is presenting it as though it is true  the supposed information supplied by the whistleblower is an

act grants wide ranging powers  those powers would need to be exercised reasonably and only to the extent necessary  Â Â   the claim is misleading  in the sense that it fails to address the safeguards that would always be applicable in any event   i cannot envisage why it would be necessary to remove the underwear of person but that said  the act is drafted broadly and perhaps such circumstance exists where it would be necessary for that to be done   he said  marco rizzi  senior lecturer at the uwa law school said  reasonableness underpins section     to make sure the powers cannot be exercised arbitrarily   while it s possible for an emergency officer to require the removal of clothing  there are guarantees built into section     to ensure it is done with decency and sensitivity   he said  removal of any clothing must be done  with regard to the gender of the relevant person  minimising intrusiveness and  where the relevant person is child  in the presence of responsible person who can provide the child with support and represent their interests   he said  under state of emergency  the government is able to respond rapidly to public emergency  in order to resolve the crisis  the government invokes range of sweeping powers that can only be used in exceptional circumstances  under the public health state of emergency that has been in place since march  emergency powers are limited to the sections listed in this document that refer to the public health act       dr eburn said there are number of laws that are in conflict with these emergency powers  one of them is the law that medical treatment requires the patient s consent   clearly the emergency powers under the public health act override all those conflicting laws   he said Â  principal researcher  nicolas

source  ty and charlene bollinger  the truth about cancer     jun      Â     this article posted by the truth about cancer on    june      is the third and last article in series claiming that vaccines are dangerous and that individuals will be forced to accept sars cov   vaccine once developed  the article  titled covid     conspiracies  vaccines    bill gates  discusses post by old thinker news and an instagram post from robert f  kennedy jr  the many claims contained in the article have been mentioned in tenths of thousands of social media posts and videos  with some versions receiving more than         views  the authors begin by falsely claiming that mainstream media and the u s  government have acknowledged that the sars cov   virus probably originated in secret bio lab in wuhan  the basis for this statement is    april editorial article by the new york post objecting to facebooks labeling of an opinion piece by new york post contributor steven w  mosher as containing misleading information  as explained in previous review by health feedback  mosher linked covid    with bioweapons research based on false and misleading statements that are not supported by current evidence  on    april  the u s  office of the director of national intelligence announced that the intelligence community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the covid    virus was not man made or genetically modified  the article also includes an entire post from    june by old thinkers news which states that gates and the world bank helped build global digital id structure before the covid    pandemic  the post is referring to id      or theÂ digital identity alliance which was launched in      by unicef  the world bank  and the bill and melinda gates foundation  id     seeks to provide digital identification to all citizens who desire it in order for them to obtain equal access to services  while improving privacy protections and giving them control over their information  however  the post uses the existence of id     to make the unsupported claim that gates intends to conduct global surveillance using covid    vaccines  this conspiracy theory mixes up two unrelated initiatives funded by the gates foundation  digital identity and vaccines  according to the id     alliance  their aim is to grant access to essential goods and services in regions where national identification systems are not possible  such as developing countries  none of the technology involved in the initiative allows for the tracking or surveillance of citizens  the idea for this conspiracy theory comes fromÂ a reddit thread in which gates mentioned the possibility of digital certificate for covid    immunity  the article also reproduces an   april instagram post from robert f  kennedy jr  containing false claims about vaccination programs that were funded by the gates foundation and conducted in partnership with the world health organization  who  and the program for appropriate technology in health  path   specifically  kennedy states that different vaccines against polio  human papillomavirus  hpv   malaria  meningitis  and tetanus  have caused severe side effects and deaths in africa and india  each one of these claims is reviewed below  the nephew of the former u s  president john f  kennedy and leader of the anti vaccine group the world mercury project  robert f  kennedy jr  is popular source of vaccine related misinformation  some of which have been reviewed by health feedback here Â here  and here  the claim that polio vaccines in india paralyzed         children between      and       has been widely debunked by afp  lead stories  and politifact  the oral poliovirus vaccine  opv  contains an attenuated strain of the virus that can be excreted from the body while immunity is building  on rare occasions  the virus can mutate into vaccine derived polioviruses  vdpvs  which are capable of causing paralysis  in populations with inadequate sanitization and low immunization coverage  an excreted virus may persist for long periods of time and start circulating among individuals  cvdpvs   the oral polio vaccine does not cause polio in those who receive the vaccine  and immunization protects against both vaccine derived and wild polioviruses  hence cvdpv outbreaks occur only in underimmunized populations among individuals who are not vaccinated  as explained in another health feedback review  as dr pascal mkanda  head of the whos polio eradication programme  explained in this november      article  the solution to cvdpv is not to stop vaccinating  but to improve vaccine coverage  since       india has reported total of       polio cases  only    of which were due to cvdpvs  after the last cases in       the country was officially declared polio free in       kennedys statement that by         of global polio cases were from gates vaccines is also highly misleading  in       when the global polio eradication initiative was launched  an estimated         children were paralyzed by polio each year  although about     of polio cases worldwide in      were due to cvdpv outbreaks  it is good to keep in mind that the total number of polio cases worldwide in      stood at      stark contrast to         in       this massive reduction in polio cases has been due to polio vaccination  overall  vaccination campaigns have eradicated polio from the vast majority of developing countries  preventing an estimated    million cases and     million deaths worldwide  kennedy also claims in his post that      experimental vaccine against hpv in india caused seven deaths  along with autoimmune and fertility disorders in       girls  the vaccines he refers to  gardasil and cervarix  were far from experimental  they had already been approved in the u s  and other countries years earlier  in fact  the aim of the      study  conducted by path  was not to test the safety or efficacy of the vaccines  but to validate the use of cost effective vaccines to reduce human papillomavirus  hpv  infections in low income communities  as previously reviewed  extensive international studies confirm an excellent safety profile of the hpv vaccine with no serious side effects  in contrast  hpv related cervical cancer killed         women in           of them in developing countries  and particularly in india  the deaths of the seven girls in the path study were investigated and found to be unrelated to the vaccines  as previously covered by politifact  reuters  and snopes  the indian government absolved the organizations involved in the hpv vaccination study of all responsibility  and never sued or banned path or the gates foundation from operating in india  as it has been suggested  however  path did receive warning for inadequately handling ethical consent  the post also inaccurately claims that three different vaccination programs funded by the gates foundation in africa caused severe side effects or deaths  the first program was clinical trial for malaria vaccine that kenedy claims killed     african infants and caused paralysis  seizure  and febrile convulsions to       of the       children  this statement is complete misrepresentation of the results published in the new england journal of medicine in        to control for side effects of the malaria vaccine  adverse events and all cause deaths were compared to two non malaria vaccination groups  only ten children manifested vaccine related effects  none of them paralysis  and all recovered  deaths were equally distributed in all groups and were due to causes unrelated to the vaccine  the study concluded that the vaccine reduced malaria in children by half of the incidence in the previous years  the effect of the vaccine persisted for one year without severe adverse effects  the second program that kennedy mentions is the      menafrivac meningitis vaccine campaign  during which he claims that the vaccine caused paralysis in    children in sub saharan africa  this was reviewed by africa check and found to be false  after complete vaccination campaign in chad  single town reported unusual reactions to the vaccine in    children and youth  later  an unvaccinated child complained of the same symptoms  an investigation by group of independent experts concluded that the events were not related to the vaccine  but to mass psychogenic phenomenon       study published inÂ the lancet showed that the vaccination campaign was highly effective and reduced the cases of meningitis in chad by       finally  kennedy repeats the old myth that the tetanus vaccine contains sterilizing formula  claim that the who has already debunked  africa check and snopes have explained that the origin of this claim is small clinical trial conducted in india in        this study aimed to develop birth control vaccine using human chorionic gonadotropin  hcg   hormone necessary for pregnancy  coupled to modified tetanus toxin as carrier  this trial was wrongly linked to the first tetanus vaccination campaigns in kenya  and the rumor of involuntary sterilization using tetanus vaccines began to spread  the use of pregnancy test kits  which were not suitable for assessing the presence of hcg in the vaccine  led to false positives that fuelled the rumours  however  laboratory analysis using more suitable technique found no hcg in the tetanus vaccine  the claim that vaccines are being used to sterilize the population was linked to gates after he stated in cnn interview in      that vaccines could reduce population growth  as explained by snopes  gates was referring to the idea that population growth can be slowed not by birth control  but by reducing childhood mortality  the foundations annual letter explains that there is correlation between infant mortality rates and fertility rates and  as the number of kids who survive to adulthood increases  parents tend to have fewer children  this theory is still subject of debate among the scientific community  to support his claims  kennedy cherry picks an observational study published in ebiomedicine in      to show that the diphtheria tetanus pertussis  dtp  vaccine increases child mortality   the data analyzed is from immunizations in the early     s using the whole cell version of the pertussis vaccine  the acellular version of the vaccineÂ  dtap  which is currently available provides shorter protection  but has fewer side effects  in addition  the study introduced an important bias by using rather small sample size and including all cause mortality events  many of them unrelated to the vaccine  more recent and extensive studies show that dtp vaccines are safe and effective in preventing disease

by jessica mcdonald posted on may          at white house meeting with fellow republicans  president donald trump said  without evidence  that the coronavirus is going to go away without vaccine  while its impossible to predict the future  experts say its unlikely that the virus will simply go away  his son eric went even further in may    interview  claiming that coronavirus will magically all of sudden go away after the november election  it is completely fanciful and not evidence based to state that sars cov   will go away without vaccine  said marc lipsitch  an epidemiologist at the harvard t h  chan school of public health  referring to the full name of the coronavirus that causes covid     there is no basis for this statement  it is theoretical possibility that the virus could go away permanently with large uncontrolled epidemic everywhere in the world  leading to depletion of susceptible people and permanent immunity  lipsitch added in an email  but  he said  that series of events would be exceedingly unlikely  since no human coronavirus is known to elicit permanent immunity  and because countries will maintain pool of people susceptible to the virus for long time  allowing for reintroductions of the virus Â  to state that the virus will go away without vaccine is baseless  lipsitch said  and to consider it as one of the top scenarios for policy planning is foolish  in an interviewÂ on fox news sunday  tom inglesby  director of the center for health security at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health  also objected to trumps claim that the virus would go away without vaccine  no  this virus isnt going to go away  he said  hopefully  over time  well learn to live with it and well be able to reduce the risk of transmission  but its going to stay as background problem in the country and around the world until we have vaccine  barry bloom  an immunologist and global health expert at harvard  also told us he did not think the virus would go away without vaccine  trumps comments cameÂ during may  Â meetingÂ at the white house with republican members of congressÂ in response to reporters questionÂ about how necessary vaccine is to resolving the pandemic  trump  may    well  i feel about vaccines like i feel about tests  this is going to go away without vaccine  its going to go away  and its  were not going to see it again  hopefully  after period of time  you may have some  some flare ups and i guess  you know  i would expect that  sometime in the fall  youll have flare ups maybe  maybe not  but according to what lot of people say  you probably will  well be able to put them out  you may have some flare ups next year  but eventually  its going to be gone  i mean  its going to be gone  you know  there are some viruses and flus that came  and they went for vaccine  they never found the vaccine  and theyve disappeared  theyve never shown up again  they got  they die too  like everything else  they die too  when asked for evidence for his position in follow up question  trump said he relied on what doctors say  adding  they say its going to go  that doesnt mean this year  it doesnt mean its going to be gone  frankly  by the fall or after the fall  but eventually  its going to go away  the question is will we need vaccine  at some point  it will probably go away by itself  if we had vaccine  that would be very helpful  id be very happy to have vaccine  the white house did not respond to our requests for support for the statement or for clarification on what the president meant by go away  but back in february  trump made similar claim  suggesting that because of warmer weather  the coronavirus would go away in april  prediction that  as we explained  was highly uncertain even at the time  and did not come to pass Â  and in an interview with fox news host jeanine pirro on may     the presidents son eric trump used similar language to make the groundless claim that the coronavirus is democratic ploy to keep his father from doing arena style campaigning  you watch  theyll milk it every single day between now and nov     the younger trump said of democrats  and guess what  after nov     coronavirus will magically all of sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen  while the president is right that the pandemic will eventually wane  scientists do not anticipate speedy retreat  and even with vaccine  there is chance the virus will continue to stick around  viruses do not do anything magically  said lipsitch  all scientific evidence and reasoning indicates that sars cov   will be spreading in large parts of the human population for months or years to come  in the absence of widespread use of an effective vaccine  anthony fauci  director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and prominent member of the coronavirus task force  has said that it will take vaccine to allow society to let up on all of its mitigation efforts Â  its not going to be over to the point of our being able to not do any mitigation until we have scientifically sound  safe and effective vaccine  he said in an april    television interview on fox news the ingraham angle  and fauci pushed back when host laura ingraham suggested  as trump later did  that this virus might disappear the way sars did  anything could  laura  but i have to tell you  the degree of efficiency  of transmissibility of this is really unprecedented in anything that ive seen  he said  its an extraordinarily efficient virus in transmitting from one person to another  those kinds of viruses dont just disappear  in senate testimony on may     fauci again said of the virus disappearing  that is just not going to happen  adding that even if there is better control of the virus in the summer  it is likely that there will be virus somewhere on this planet that will eventually get back to us  fauci also previously cautioned that while conditions in the u s  would improve  there could be an ongoing risk Â   i f you want to get to pre coronavirus  you know  that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there  he said in an april   task force briefing  but i believe  with the therapies that will be coming online  and with the fact that i feel confident that over period of time we will get good vaccine  that we will never have to get back to where we are right back now  the world health organization  too  has said that while vaccine is humanitys best chance of getting rid of the virus  even then  there is no guarantee that the virus will go completely away  i think its important to put this on the table  said michael ryan  the executive director of the whos health emergencies programme  in may    press conference  this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away  i dont think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear  we do have one great hope  ryan continued  if we do find highly effective vaccine that we can distribute to everyone who needs it in the world  we may have shot at eliminating this virus  but that vaccine will have to be highly effective  it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it  ryan noted that the world has failed to eliminate other viral diseases  such as measles  even with readily available  effective vaccines  there are no promises in this and there are no dates  he said  adding that there was possibility covid    might settle into long term problem  how the covid    pandemic will unfold cant be known  but some scientists have attempted to model how the virus will spread under different assumptions to understand what the possibilities might be  lipsitch was part of team at harvard that created model of sars cov   transmission in temperate regions of the world  factoring in different levels of seasonality  immunity and cross immunity to two common cold coronaviruses  oc   and hku   publishing in the journal science in mid april  the team found that repeated wintertime outbreaks will probably occur  and even if the virus might appear to go away  resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as       in many of the teams simulations  sars cov   continues to circulate long term  if immunity to the virus lasts bit less than year  on par with the common cold coronaviruses  then the coronavirus might return annually  longer  two year period of immunity pushes the viruss reappearance into biennial or more sporadic pattern  in the unlikely case that immunity is permanent  then the virus could disappear for five or more years  the study found  but even in cases in which the virus might seem to die out  sars cov   could make comeback several years later  these scenarios do not factor in any mitigation measures  but other modeling from the group suggests that one time lockdowns wont be enough to control the virus  we found that one time social distancing measures are likely to be insufficient to maintain the incidence of sars cov   within the limits of critical care capacity in the united states  said co author stephen kissler  postdoctoral research fellow at harvard  in press call  and so what seems could be necessary in the absence of other sorts of treatments are intermittent social distancing periods  while the team does not endorse any particular strategy  the basic idea with intermittent social distancing would be to try to space out the number of infections enough so that the health care system never gets overloaded  but that over time  immunity to the virus builds Â  if approximately        of given population were to become infected and develop immunity  then that could provide so called community or herd immunity  preventing spread to those who still remain susceptible  and causing outbreaks to eventually peter out  this type of slow build immunity approach is one way that the pandemic could end without vaccine  annelies wilder smith  professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine  told us   the other involves highly unlikely global containment effort  involving simultaneous wuhan level lockdown in every country  Â  but it would take long time  she said  perhaps two to four years  and  as weve established  would not necessarily bring true end to the virus  work by others also suggests the virus will be around for the long haul  in an april    report released by the university of minnesotas center for infectious disease research and policy  researchers outlined three possible scenarios  based on what is known about sars cov   and past experience with epidemics  in the first so called peaks and valleys scenario  the first wave of infection would be followed by series of well defined waves that gradually diminish in       in second scenario  the virus returns in the fall or winter with vengeance  akin to what happened with the      influenza pandemic  producing much larger wave of infections than the current one  followed up by smaller subsequent waves  in the third slow burn scenario  infections would continue at lower level after the first surge  but wouldnt follow clear wave pattern  regardless of the scenario the pandemic follows  the report cautions that we must be prepared for at least another    to    months of significant covid    activity  with hot spots popping up periodically in diverse geographic areas  and the report notes that the virus may not go away  even if the pandemic resolves   as the pandemic wanes  it is likely that sars cov   will continue to circulate in the human population and will synchronize to seasonal pattern with diminished severity over time  similar to what has happened with past pandemic influenza viruses and the more mild human coronaviruses that cause colds  indeed  although trump suggested that viruses disappear  never to return  without vaccines  thats not actually what happens in most cases  im hard pressed to think of any viruses that disappeared on their own  columbia epidemiologist stephen morse told us  once they gain foothold  most viruses are hard to eliminate  especially respiratory viruses  influenza  flu  doesnt go away  it just keeps coming back in new guises  far from disappearing  even after all the waves of pandemic conclude  pandemic influenza viruses return as seasonal influenza viruses Â  they settle down and evolve  key surface protein  the hemagglutinin  h  mutating to get past our immune systems  said morse  allowing the new variant to reinfect  even people already immune from having had the pandemic  versions of the h n  influenza strain that caused the      pandemic  for example  continue to circulate  the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that the virus led to at least     million illnesses and        deaths between      and      in the u s  alone  and that is with vaccine that became available in october      and is estimated to have prevented up to     million clinical cases  in fact  morse said every seasonal flu the world knows is the descendant of pandemic virus  the common cold coronaviruses that infect humans today are also examples of viruses that never disappeared  these viruses are thought to have emerged from animals in the past  the most recent one around       according to genetic analysis of oc    although still speculative  the authors of that study think its possible that oc   may have been responsible for the           pandemic when it crossed over into humans from cows Â  these coronaviruses do not mutate to the extent that influenza does  morse said  but immunity to the viruses is short lived  so the viruses are able to reinfect people after period of time and also tend to exhibit seasonal pattern  there is the example of the sars  or severe acute respiratory syndrome  virus  which led to an outbreak in      that was successfully contained  other than few lingering cases and couple mishaps in lab in       the virus has not returned  although there is still the risk the virus could reemerge if humans interact with animals harboring the virus  but that virus never spread as widely as sars cov    infecting only about       people in fewer than   Â countries  in contrast  as of may     there have been more than     million covid    cases in     countries  according to the johns hopkins covid    tracker  sars cov    morse said  was not as transmissible as its successor  and the bulk of the transmission was in health care settings  once the affected facilities implemented rigorous infection control  he said  they could control sars in the facility and it eventually stopped  what will ultimately happen with sars cov   is unknown  as the trajectory  morse said  will depend on the virus  on how we behave  and on our immune systems  but there is little precedent for virus that has spread so efficiently to go away  as the president claimed  morse said that long term  there isnt enough evidence to know whether the coronavirus will follow the path of seasonal flu virus  mutating and periodically reinfecting  or that of seasonal coronavirus  periodically reinfecting after while  and

in q web page about  g and health  the world health organization  who  said no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies   it noted that tissue heating is

attention in      with seemingly break through study on chronic fatigue syndrome  but the paper was later retracted when the findings could not be replicated  and researchers theorized that the original findings were likely due to contamination  mikovits  fall from grace continued when she was briefly jailed on charges of theft from the laboratory that performed the ill fated study    every

rna virus that works       this is false    we know that vaccines have saved millions  not killed millions   newland told afp by phone  university of texas at austin s dr  jason mclellan  associate professor of molecular biosciences  said by email   this is obviously false   regarding rna viruses  influenza is an rna virus and there is vaccine that we take every year for it  measles is also an rna virus and there is very good vaccine for it  other rna viruses for which there are vaccines include rabies  rubella  and mumps virus   he said  coronavirus expert dr  julian leibowitz of texas m

cases  to just name two vaccine success stories  there are many more     i wouldn t use the word  created   but you can t say  naturally occurring  if it was by way of the laboratory   mikovits says of the novel coronavirus  origin   it s very clear this virus was manipulated  and this is what was released  whether deliberate or not   this is false   this is wrong on so many levels   leibowitz said   there is no evidence that sars cov   is laboratory created virus      claim  us funding for china coronavirus experiments contributed to outbreak mikovits claims that the national institute of allergy and infectious disease    the division of the national institutes of health run by dr  anthony fauci    is partially to blame for the novel coronavirus pandemic  since the agency funded coronavirus experiments in laboratory in wuhan  china  this is misleading   she states that the us was working with wuhan to study coronaviruses years ago  like it s  gotcha  moment  yes  of course we were doing this    china is coronavirus hotspot and it makes sense to study this family of viruses where it naturally occurs   vanderbilt university pathology fellow dr  kathleen montgomery said in an email  leibowitz said that there is no evidence that coronavirus studies in wuhan are linked to the covid    outbreak  in response to the claim  the nih said by email that it and the  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases are focused on critical research aimed at ending the covid    pandemic and preventing further deaths  we are not engaging in tactics by some seeking to derail our efforts      claim  hospitals are incentivized to report covid    diagnoses     mikovits also claims in the video that hospitals get          from medicare if you call it covid      if the patient goes on ventilator  the hospital receives three times as much money  the video claims  doctors are putting patients on ventilators unnecessarily  mikovits says   you ve killed them with the ventilator  cause you gave them the wrong treatment   this is misleading   we don t want to intubate anyone  we want everyone to get better   said newland    there s this suggestion that we d rather intubate to make more money  well that s just not how doctors work  or clinicians in general   montgomery agreed   there is no evidence to support the idea that physicians are incorrectly diagnosing covid    due to financial incentive   she said  spokesperson for centers for medicare and medicaid services confirmed that the agency implemented section      of the coronavirus aid  relief  and economic security  cares  act on april           which increases payment for covid    cases by    percent  the increase  is not bonus   the cms spokesperson said by email  but rather step to protect the health of patients and providers during the outbreak  although medicare would generally pay more for patient who needed ventilator than one who did not   medicare providers are required to accurately bill for services provided based on beneficiary s diagnosis   the spokesperson said   claims with inaccurate diagnosis  would be subject to recoupment and or other potential civil or criminal charges for false claims        the video includes several false or misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine   the decades old malaria drug is  working great  for covid    patients  claims an unnamed man in scrubs featured in the  plandemic  video  this is false  study published may         reported no harm or benefit to using hydroxychloroquine for covid    patients  newland said   voiceover in the video says that   in survey polling nearly       doctors in some    countries  hydroxychloroquine was ranked as the most effective medication to treat the virus   this is misleading  in an april interview with  fox and friends   fauci addressed study which found that given list of    options     percent of more than       doctors in    countries said hydroxychloroquine is the most effective treatment against the disease   we don t operate on how you feel  we operate on what evidence is   he said   granted that there is suggestion of benefit there  i think we ve gotta be careful that we don t make that majestic leap to assume that this is knockout drug   public health authorities in multiple countries have said that clinical trials were needed to determine the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine  mikovits also claims in the video that the american medical association  was saying doctors will lose their license if they use hydroxychloroquine   this too is false  the only ama guidance related to prescribing or dispensing of covid    medication is joint statement with the american pharmacists association and american society of health system pharmacists  available here  spokesperson said  the statement reads   novel off label use of fda approved medications is matter for the physician s or other prescriber s professional judgment   the us food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization allowing healthcare providers to prescribe hydroxychloroquine for adults unable to participate in clinical trials  along with dosage and administration guidance        the flu vaccines increase the odds by    percent of getting covid      mikovits claims in the video  citing this study   this is false  data for the study was gathered during the           flu season  before the novel coronavirus was discovered  mclellan said   so no claims can be made about the influenza vaccines and sars cov   covid      the results show that statistically significant     percent of people who got flu shot tested positive for coronavirus  compared to     percent of people who did not receive coronavirus vaccine  he said  but the data is correlative  not causative  and the coronaviruses in question are the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold  not covid       this is novel virus   newland said   the flu vaccine is gonna have no impact one way or the other   afp fact check has addressed previous claims about flu vaccines here and here       two doctors who gave controversial press conference criticizing stay at home measures also appear in the video  one says that masks and gloves worsen the immune system  while the other says that this reduces  bacterial flora   making you more likely to get  opportunistic infections   and mikovits says that   wearing the mask literally activates your own virus  you re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions and if it happens to be sars cov    then you ve got big problem    these claims are false  dr  shelley payne  director of the lamontagne center for infectious disease at the university of texas at austin  said in an email that  there is no evidence that masks or gloves reduce the normal microbiota or predispose people to opportunistic infections    while the presence of the microbiota is important to development of the immune system early in life  and it does indeed provide protection against some opportunistic pathogens   the microbiota does not disappear when gloves or mask is worn  and it is not necessary to be exposed to additional microbes in the environment to maintain the microbiota   leibowitz said he knows of no data that suggests masks weaken the immune system   in fact in terms of opportunistic infections i think that they would decrease your risk of infection     payne added that wearing mask will not reactivate your own virus    the cloth just filters out particles from the air  afp fact check has previously written about claims on mask effectiveness during the covid    pandemic here        why would you close the beach   mikovits asks near the end of the video  referring to social distancing measures taken by us states to help prevent the spread of covid      you ve got sequences in the soil  in the sand  you ve got healing microbes in the ocean  in the salt water  that s insanity   this is misleading  beaches were closed to promote social distancing and prevent hospital intensive care units from being overwhelmed  and so far the measures have worked  newland said   if we have bunch of people on top of each other on these local beaches  the risk is having that large amount of people potentially getting sick    leibowitz said that  although it is true that antibiotic secreting species can be recovered from soil  recovering these bacteria is not easy   noting that the ocean also contains species associated with  flesh eating infections    as long as people maintain adequate social distancing on the beach  he continued   beaches would be as safe or dangerous as they were before covid       and newland said that while the beach might have some healing nature just because it makes people happy   now isn t

source  alex pietrowski  facebook users  waking times     may      Â      summary   claim that rna vaccine technology  which is being used to develop covid    vaccine candidate  will permanently alter your dna was published in an article by waking times in may       forming the basis for many viral posts on social media  the claim has received more than         views at the time of this reviews publication  although the original article has since been corrected following fact check by politifact  the posts that reshared the articles content have not been corrected and continue to propagate this claim  see an example here   scientists who examined the claims scientific credibility told health feedback that the claim is inaccurate and results from fundamental misunderstanding of how rna vaccines work and how nucleic acids  dna and rna  interact with the human body  robert carnahan  an associate professor at vanderbilt university and associate director of the vanderbilt vaccine center  explained that while rna vaccines represent new innovation  they are based on longstanding foundational scientific principles  rna serves as the recipe or blueprint that instructs cells to make particular protein  after it has served its purpose  cells in the body have innate mechanisms of degrading this rna and not allowing it to persist  he said  therefore  any rna injected from vaccine will not persist long enough to cause autoimmune disorders  which are chronic diseases       study published by science advances estimated that rna used as protein blueprints  messenger rna or mrna  generally lasted for mere two minutes in yeast cells     another study in mice found that mrna decayed after about three days post injection     carnahan also pointed out that rna is chemically different from dna  making it virtually impossible for rna to directly integrate into dna to change persons genome  while concerns over the safety profile of the potential vaccines are natural  given the accelerated vaccine development timeline imposed by the urgency of the covid    pandemic  sanjay mishra  staff scientist and project coordinator at vanderbilt university medical center  explained that rna vaccines are considered to be extremely safe based on past research       safety studies have concluded that there is little concern for integration of dna into genomes  mrna vaccines are even safer and advantageous because rna itself cannot integrate into genomic dna without the presence of retrovirus element  such as reverse transcriptase and integrase  he said  in fact  we can recognize that the fear of foreign dna or rna integrating into and changing our own genome is unfounded when we remember that we come into daily contact with large amount of foreign dna and rna from other organisms in the environment  for example  we ingest dna and rna in our food  in addition  our bodies host billions of microorganisms  such as bacteria and fungi  which colonize different tissues and organs  such as our skin and digestive tract  furthermore  in people who have received blood transfusions or organ transplants  scientists have not observed the dna of the donor to integrate into the recipients dna  let alone alter it  angÃ©line rouers  research fellow at the singapore immunology network  said that given the well established safety profile of nucleic acid vaccines  scientists are instead more concerned with whether the vaccine would provide long lasting immunity against sars cov    although there is also some indication that rna vaccines might be able to provide better response against viral infection than conventional vaccines containing viral protein  rna vaccines have the advantage of eliciting both cellular  cytotoxic and helper t cells  and humoral immunity  antibodies   while classical vaccines  based on protein  usually focus more on antibody production to the detriment of cellular immunity       she said  in the case of immunity against virus such as sars cov    the t cell response is particularly important  the claim that an rna vaccine can provoke an autoimmune response is also not supported by scientific evidence  mishra acknowledged that while dna or rna vaccines could theoretically cause autoimmunity  observations in published studies have shown the opposite and highlight the potential of rna vaccines for treating autoimmune disorders instead  pre clinical testing and careful clinical monitoring have shown dna vaccines not only do not induce or worsen auto immunity  they in fact therapeutically benefit in autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis       he said  it is also inaccurate to liken an rna vaccine to gene therapy  gene therapy is specially designed to introduce dna into patients genome for the sake of treating disease  involving the use of viral vectors which provide the molecular machinery for introducing and integrating the dna into patients genetic material  from the u s  national library of medicine  gene therapy is designed to introduce genetic material into cells to compensate for abnormal genes or to make beneficial protein  if mutated gene causes necessary protein to be faulty or missing  gene therapy may be able to introduce normal copy of the gene to restore the function of the protein  gene that is inserted directly into cell usually does not function  instead  carrier called vector is genetically engineered to deliver the gene  certain viruses are often used as vectors because they can deliver the new gene by infecting the cell  the viruses are modified so they cant cause disease when used in people  some types of virus  such as retroviruses  integrate their genetic material  including the new gene  into chromosome in the human cell  other viruses  such as adenoviruses  introduce their dna into the nucleus of the cell  but the dna is not integrated into chromosome  the vector can be injected or given intravenously  by iv  directly into specific tissue in the body  where it is taken up by individual cells  alternately  sample of the patients cells can be removed and exposed to the vector in laboratory setting  the cells containing the vector are then returned to the patient  if the treatment is successful  the new gene delivered by the vector will make functioning protein  however  rna is not used in gene therapy and viral vectors are not used in rna vaccines  which makes the comparison to gene therapy fundamentally faulty  the claim that the covid vaccine will use experimental technology is unsupported and misleading  scientists worldwide are using different approaches to maximize the chances of developing successful vaccine quickly  some of these approaches are well established  like classical vaccines which use proteins to elicit an immune response  while others are more novel like the rna vaccine  media attention has contributed to high expectations for rna vaccine technology in addressing the covid    pandemic  but it is still unknown exactly which vaccines will show sufficiently high level of safety and efficacy to be approved for the market until clinical trials are completed  in fact  gates pointed out in his blog that we dont know yet what the covid    vaccine will look like  the new york times coronavirus vaccine tracker has compiled details about the various covid    vaccine candidates under development  including the technique used and how far each one has risen through the succession of clinical trial stages  as of    june       more than     vaccine candidates are being developed and tested  in summary  the claim that rna vaccines can alter our dna is scientifically unfounded  chemical differences prevent rna from directly integrating into our dna  and studies examining the potential integration of nucleic acid vaccines into dna have confirmed that such changes are not known to occur       the claim that rna from vaccine can cause autoimmunity is also unsupported  as rna has very short lifespan  being quickly degraded after it has been used to make protein  this means that rna does not persist long enough to cause chronic problems like autoimmune disorders  taken together  these characteristics make rna vaccines generally safe option for inducing immunity against infectious diseases  although its efficacy against covid    has yet to be determined   scientists feedback    sanjay mishra  staff scientist  vanderbilt university medical center  while there is theoretical possibility of dna  or rna  vaccines causing autoimmunity or that the dna would integrate into the human genome  pre clinical testing and careful clinical monitoring have shown dna vaccines not only do not induce or worsen auto immunity  they in fact therapeutically benefit in autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis       unlike viral vectors for gene therapy  the nucleic acid vaccines are considered so safe that they do not need to be evaluated by the national institutes of health  nih  recombinant advisory committee prior to human clinical trials  safety studies have concluded that there is little concern for integration of dna into genomes  mrna vaccines are even safer and advantageous because rna itself cannot integrate into genomic dna without the presence of retrovirus element  reverse transcriptase and integrase   it is possible that some recipients of an mrna vaccine might be already infected with retrovirus  e g   hiv   where theoretically such integration could happen  but the risk of integration  like gene therapy  is extremely unlikely for mrna  and is not significant concern for plasmid dna  from regulatory perspective  dna and mrna vaccines do not count as gene therapy products   robert carnahan  associate professor  pediatrics and radiology and radiologic sciences   vanderbilt university medical center  in many cases  the principle of given vaccine is to expose the body to key protein  called an antigen  that leads to the development of long term immunity to the pathogen from which the antigen protein originates  in the case of rna vaccines  rather than directly giving the body the actual protein  an rna which instructs cells in the body as to how to make the antigen protein is given  though these rna vaccines represent new innovation  they are based on longstanding  foundational scientific principles  rna itself is used in all cells in the body as short lived blueprint for building proteins within the cells  that is key safety advantage for using it to provide message encoding the antigen protein  the cells in the body have innate mechanisms of degrading this rna and not allowing it to persist  moreover  though rna is related to dna  it is chemically distinct and is not able to integrate into the dna  this means that these vaccines will not modify the dna of the cells  and also will not be present for prolonged periods to cause other long term effects like autoimmune disorders   angÃ©line rouers  research fellow  singapore immunology network  these viral facebook posts are based on an article written by alex pietrowski for waking times and it reports two citations  one from bill gates about the uncertainties of the rna vaccine under development to protect against covid     and the other from journalist named jon rappoport  claiming that nucleic acid vaccines  which include both rna and dna vaccines  can modify the genome or lead to autoimmune reactions and are therefore unsafe  the citation of bill gates  from his blog gatesnotes  has clearly been misinterpreted and taken out of context  it is true that not much is known about rna vaccines  such as the one under development by company called moderna  among many other vaccine candidates in the world  but the uncertainty is more about the ability of the vaccine to protect efficiently against sars cov    rather than its safety  how many doses will be required  or is the immunity long lasting  are the kind of questions still pending  nucleic acid vaccines are actually incredibly safe  which was part of their success at the time of their discovery  you have to imagine that you simply give the blueprint  genetic code  to your body to construct the viral protein on its own  so it can learn how to fight against the virus  in terms of manufacturing  it is easier and faster than producing the protein used in classical vaccines  thats the reason why some companies like moderna chose this option in the context of the current covid    pandemicto enable them to release vaccine as fast as possible  even if not much is known about the expected efficiency of rna vaccines  they have the advantage of eliciting both cellular  cytotoxic and helper t cells  and humoral immunity  antibodies   while classical vaccines  based on protein  usually focus more on antibody production to the detriment of cellular immunity       in the case of immunity against virus such as sars cov    the t cell response is particularly important  the claim by jon rappoport is simply misinformation and is not based on any scientific evidence  dna or rna vaccines are considered as carriers of information  but there is no chance that these molecules would incorporate into the human genome  part of his claim is that rna vaccines would carry the danger of triggering autoimmune reactions  meaning the body basically goes to war against itself  which is also completely false  i suspect that this may stem from confusion based on the fact that rna vaccines guide the body to create protein  which the bodys own immune system will target  the principle of autoimmunity is that our body recognizes and destroys our own components  however  in the case of the rna vaccine  the protein made by our body is something unrelated with our own proteins  so there is no chance of an autoimmune reaction but reaction against something unknown to teach our body to fight against it

microsoft founder bill gates is rich man  he has put some of that wealth toward charitable organizations and initiatives through the bill and melinda gates foundation  primary focus of that foundation  and of gates philanthropy in general  is the reduction of inequalities in health outcomes  with focus on the developing world  via these organizations  he also funds research into technological solutions to public health problems in the poorest communities globally  since       he has been raising alarms about the worlds potentially catastrophic lack of preparedness for pandemic Â  in part because of his advocacy for vaccines  gates has also been major recipient of the anti vaccine movements vitriol for well over decade  years of manufactured animosity built by false claims from these anti vaccine groups have  as the covid    pandemic unfolded  combined with the dubious claims of doomsday soothsayers and cryptocurrency youtubers to create sprawling covid    conspiracy theory centered on gates  the basic allegation against gates goes like this  he is using the covid    pandemic as pretext to push vaccine with microchip capable of tracking you along with the rest of the world population  from factual standpoint  gates has never proposed or funded research into the development of vaccine  for covid    or for anything else  that includes the injection of device that could actively track your location  monitor anything you are doing  or control you  the bill and melinda gates foundation did fund pilot study conducted by mit and rice university researchers into potential vaccine delivery device that could impart an invisible mark detectable by smartphone  this study was theoretical  the technology described was passive  and the device was incapable of any sort of tracking or monitoring  still  much of the credence lent to the false notion that gates has designs to track you using vaccines comes from mixing the existence of that pilot study with another public health concept gates is actively involved in researching called digital identity  the basic premise behind digital  or decentralized  identity in the context of gates work is simple  it would involve some sort of cloud based storage of medical and or personal identification documents accessible only with the consent of the owner but available anywhere in the world  crucially  such concept  whose central scientific challenges are in the realm of encryption and blockchains  has nothing to do with anything injected into the body  despite this  conspiracy theorists falsely use gates support for digital identity initiatives as evidence of his intentions to build vaccine enabled surveillance state  as someone who has funded general research into vaccines and pandemics  gates has made several public statements on the present crisis  broadly speaking  these statements reflect gates commitment to researching and developing both treatments and vaccines for covid     and to stressing the need for scalable method to quickly identify people who have either recovered from covid    or received vaccination against it as means to restart the global economy  for example  in an interview with chris anderson  who runs ted talks  gates indicated he believes some sort of immunity certificate will be instrumental in reopening the global economy  eventually what well have to have is certificates of whos recovered person and whos vaccinated person  because you dont want people moving around the world where youll have some countries that wont have it under control  sadly  you dont want to completely block off the ability for those people to go there and come back and move around  so eventually there will be sort of this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up  in reddit ask me anything  ama  discussion from march       gates further detailed his views on disease surveillance in the united states  the testing in the us is not organized yet  in the next few weeks i hope the government fixes this by having website you can go to to find out about home testing and kiosks  things are bit confused on this right now  in seattle  the  university of washington  is providing thousands of tests per day but no one is connected to national tracking system  whenever there is positive test it should be seen to understand where the disease is and whether we need to strengthen the social distancing  gates has praised the more extreme disease surveillance measures taken by south korea as model for future pandemic preparedness  south korea has had considerable success in limiting deaths from covid    thanks in large part to aggressive contact tracing  described in an april      report by the brookings institute  south korea was effective in tracing people who may have come into contact with those who tested positive for covid     nearly all south korean citizens have smartphones and use credit cards  so when someone tests positive  the government can trace where they have been  at what time  and what mode of transportation they used  with this data  the government can trace the potentially infected population  using cctv footage to identify potential contacts when needed  those in close contact with the infected are asked to get tested  while indirect contacts are ordered to self quarantine for fourteen days  this is an arduous process  but the south korean government has maintained the ability to trace and contact potentially infected persons  Â the theory that bill gates wants to use vaccine to track people based on any of these statements or views is flawed for at least two reasons  first  nothing he has advocated for above necessitates injecting tracking device into body  instead these theoretical technologies would rely on combination of biometric identification  encryption  and cloud storage of data  second  as shown by south korea  the injection of tracking devices via vaccines would likely be waste of time  given the fact that most of humanity is constantly connected to gps enabled smartphone that probably knows more about you than your parents  the sole bit of evidence used to suggest bill gates interest in adding anything that resembles microchip in vaccines stems from his foundations funding of study  published in science translational medicine in december       that developed dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near infrared light emitting microparticles to the skin that can  when exposed to certain frequencies of light  identify the immunization status of infants  in several developing countries  lack of reliable immunization records can  the authors argued  affect the quality of care provided  the study  which was not conducted on human subjects  did not describe the injection of microchip co administered with vaccine  instead  it described the use of something referred to as quantum dot  these dots are essentially molecule sized particles engineered to have unique structures that react to near infrared light in way that could theoretically be identified by device such as smartphone  it is physically impossible to implant quantum dot sized device that could actively ping location or any other data to an unknown third party  further  this sort of researchÂ   if it ever came to fruition in the first place  is in its infancy  and would be years away from actual implementation anywhere  let alone in potential covid    vaccine that scientists estimate could be available potentially within    months  nonetheless  this study is crucial to the conspiracy theory  as that narrative is dependent on conflating quantum dots with gates work in digital identities  thats why it is important to understand the misrepresentations made of the gates funded group id      id      or the digital identity alliance  is    c  non profit funded by diverse range of foundations and corporate sponsors  including microsoft and the gates funded vaccine non profit gavi  that provides grants for practical research into the real world application of digital identities  the id     alliance provides funding and other forms of material support for high impact and high quality digital identity projects that are privacy protecting  user centric  and designed for scale  impact  and replicability  proposals are accepted on rolling basis at various stages of development  any individual or organization meeting the required application and evaluation criteria is welcome to submit proposal  several of the projects funded by id     have been characterized by anti vaccine activists as using the poor and vulnerable as scientific guinea pigs involving the implantation of device that infringes on their privacy  outside of the fact that none of these projects involve injecting subjects with anything  the philosophical premise implied by such claims is also in direct opposition to what id     seeks to accomplish  its goal  however lofty  is to develop system in which the individual has complete control over personal identification or health documentation  the end product would be system that allows this sort of information to be accessible anywhere in the world but only with your consent  the id     manifesto makes this explicit  over   billion people worldwide are unable to prove their identity through any recognized means  as such  they are without the protection of law  and are unable to access basic services  participate as citizen or voter  or transact in the modern economy   we believe that individuals must have control over their own digital identities  including how personal data is collected  used  and shared  everyone should be able to assert their identity across institutional and national borders  and across time  privacy  portability  and persistence are necessary for digital identity to meaningfully empower and protect individuals  one pilot project associated with id     is mypass  which is an effort to provide digital identification to the homeless population of austin  texas  though id     is not funding mypass  the city of austins innovation office is an id     partner  and id     staff did participate in workshop with the city in june       according to an id     spokesperson  the project  still in its infancy  seeks to create an online  cloud based repository of identification and medical documents  early versions of the pilot study would likely use some combination of qr code card given to participating individuals  but future work could involve biometrics like fingerprints or iris scans  importantly  the participants in the study volunteered to be in it  can opt out at any time  and did not and will not have anything injected into them  another project  currently active in bangladesh and tanzania  seeks to test the viability of tying infant fingerprints to digital identities  these projects are small pilot studies with limited relevance to the current covid    pandemic  and none of them involves injecting anything into anyone  let alone something that would contain the functionality that would enable any sort of active tracking or surveillance  still  conspiracy theorists have pushed the above facts into an unfounded but paranoid narrative  as stated above  bill gates has been interested in using vaccines to combat health inequalities for over decade  though it has no relevance to the claims at issue for covid     the assertion that bill gates interest in vaccines stems from goal of depopulating the world is almost universally included as part of that narrative as means to imbue gates actions with nefarious intent  that false conclusion stems from grotesque misreading of gates argument that communities with access to vaccination tend to have lower birth rates because reduced childhood mortality means more children will survive into adulthood  as also discussed above  gates has been interested in  and financially supportive of  the concept of digital identification as another means of reducing health inequality globally  the narrative pushed by conspiracy theorists involves conflating the concept of digital identification with the injection of device  for example  appearing in an interview by far right christian conspiracy theorist rick wiles on his trunews platform  guest asserted without evidence that both concepts were directly related  what bill gates said was eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered  who has been tested  and we will have  record of who  received  covid     through that digital certificate  now that digital certificate might just sound like something simple  maybe its computer document  thats not exactly whats going on here   Â  this project has researchers at mit and rice university with funding from the bill and melinda gates foundation working to create that digital certificate system  its going to be chip that actually is implanted into humans  as previously explained  the mit rice study was not conducted by the id     alliance  and id     funded projects are not experimenting with injecting things into people  natural news  supplement store and alternative health conspiracy blog  similarly conflated digital identity with quantum dot technology to portray gates as an agent of satan  keep in mind that this all coincides with the id     agenda  which aims to create global digital identification system for every person on earth  as weve reported in the past  id     and vaccines are being used together to harvest the biometric identities of all mankind  and all for the purpose of creating the global system of tracking and control that was foretold in the book of revelation  theyve already begun to test id     in bangladesh  inserting digital ids in the bodies of newborn babies along with their vaccinations  and bill gates is now talking about how so called quantum dot tattoos are the next wave of biometrics identification  also to be inserted in peoples bodies through vaccination  ignoring the fact that id     is not product capable of being tested  the bangladesh project natural news references here does not involve dead babies  nor does it involve the insertion of anything into anyone  its an exercise in imaging infant fingerprints  in sum  the contention that gates is using covid    as pretense to inject monitoring devices into humans relies on misrepresentation of the research he has funded  the methods those projects have employed  and confusion over what digital identity seeks to achieve  if and when vaccine for covid    comes  it will not be capable of tracking your movements or reporting any data to any entity whatsoever  none of the technology discussed by gates here is even capable of such task  pandemics are global catastrophes with few easy answers  gates  private citizen with no ability to mandate policy or govern international health organizations  has spent over decade funding research into various strategies that could mitigate their effect  his ideas  though supported by many scientists  are not decrees  instead  his focus has been on understanding the likely viability and efficacy of various counter pandemic and public health strategies  these initiatives have been blended into false narrative involving an as yet undeveloped covid    vaccine combined with made up microchip device unlike anything gates has ever been involved in  as such  the claim that gates is planning to microchip you via covid    vaccination is false  the

in march       rumor started to circulate on social media claiming that the world has been using vaccine for coronavirus on cattle for years  and that the current panic about growing covid    pandemic was being overblown by the media   however  as of this writing  no vaccine currently exists for the novel coronavirus that causes the covid    disease  the confusion seems to stem from misunderstanding of the word coronavirus  while this word was frequently used in the early days of the covid    pandemic to describe the virus that causes the new disease  coronavirus is actually broad term that refers to group of viruses  the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  writes  coronaviruses are named for the crown like spikes on their surface  there are four main sub groupings of coronaviruses  known as alpha  beta  gamma  and delta  human coronaviruses were first identified in the mid     s   there are  seven coronaviruses that can infect people the above displayed photograph does show real vaccine used to treat bovine coronavirus  this vaccine  however  is not effective in humans or against the new strain of coronavirus that emerged at the end of      Â  this product  called scourgard  k  is for the vaccination of healthy  pregnant cows and heifers as an aid in preventing diarrhea in their calves caused by bovine rotavirus  serotypes g  and g     bovine coronavirus  and enterotoxigenic strains of escherichia coli having the k   pili adherence factor  ming tan  faculty member of the division of infectious diseases at cincinnati childrens hospital medical center  told politifact that  the coronavirus used in the bovine rotavirus coronavirus vaccine is distinct from the current coronavirus  the antibodies produced by the bovine rotavirus coronavirus vaccine will not recognize the current coronavirus and thus will not protect humans from infection  although the disease at the center of the covid    pandemic was often referred to as simply coronavirus in the early days of       more scientific name has since emerged  according to the world health organization  the virus is called sars cov    severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    and the disease is referred to as covid    Â  to sum up  the word coronavirus refers to group of viruses  not one specific pathogen  vaccine that is developed for particular strain of coronavirus  such as bovine coronavirus  sars  or mers  is not necessarily going to be effective against other variations in this group  at the moment  no vaccine exists for sars cov    for these reasons  we rate this claim false  reuters  Â  partly false claim  cattle vaccine for coronavirus has been around for years  media dishonest about recent outbreak,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0.]

with about     of australians fully vaccinated against the coronavirus  the country s vaccine rollout has lagged behind other developed countries  to accelerate it  some social media users say the country is taking drastic action  in july    instagram post  fan page for conservative commentator candace owens wrote that the australian military is going door to door  looking for anti vaxxers    why has this not been done  looking for pedofiles  sic   drug dealers  rapists  human traffickers    reads text in the post  which has more than        likes  the claim has been shared in dozens of posts on facebook and instagram  according to crowdtangle  social media insights tool  but there s no evidence to suggest it s accurate  fact check  viral meme makes false claim about delta variant usa today reached out to the instagram account that shared the post for comment  australia s coronavirus vaccine rollout does not yet include door to door vaccination effort  thoughÂ military officialsÂ have been appointed toÂ aid in theÂ rollout  usa today could find no evidence the military is seeking out anti vaccine advocates  either  the confusion online may stem from the fact that  on june   Â prime ministerÂ scott morrison announcedÂ lt  gen  john frewen as head of the country s covid    vaccine task force  frewen s appointment followed that ofÂ navy commodore eric young in april as logistics manager for the vaccine program  there s no evidence to suggest those military officials are leading an effort to seek out anti vaxxers  coronavirus vaccines are available from participating stateÂ vaccination clinics  general practices  pharmacies and aboriginal community health services  according to the australia health department  the agency does not mention door to door vaccination on its website  the covid    vaccine is not mandatory in australia  in the u s   however  door to door effort is now part of the vaccine rollout  and it s becomeÂ a target of online misinformation  on july    president joe biden called for door to door campaign to promote vaccination against covid     at the time  only about     of americans had been fully vaccinated  fact check  airlines are not banning vaccinated people from flying  now we need to go to community by community  neighborhood by neighborhood  and oftentimesÂ door to door  literally knocking on doors  to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus   biden said during remarks in washington Â Â Â Â  that component of the u s  rollout  which relies on volunteers and public health officials in states like north carolina  was implemented in april after the passage of the      trillion covid    relief package  local volunteers  not federal employees  are going door to door to give people information about the coronavirus vaccines  as several independent fact checking organizations have reported  it s worth noting that  similar to australia  the coronavirus vaccine is not required in the u s  and the federal government isn t keeping track of who has received it  usa today reached out to the australian defense departmentÂ for comment  but it did not provide one on the record  the claim that the australian military is going door to door  looking for anti vaxxers  is false  based on our research  there s no evidence to suggest the military is coordinating door to door vaccination campaign in australia  where the coronavirus vaccine is voluntary,[0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
