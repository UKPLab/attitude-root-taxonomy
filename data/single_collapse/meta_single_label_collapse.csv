An alternative interpretive framework for the existing epidemiology and vaccine statistics,5
"Physicians, even those specialising in vaccination, could not accurately distinguish clinically between a variety of viruses artificially inoculated in a subject (different species such as syphilis, smallpox, and other animal contagions produced clinically ambiguous signs), and thus they could neither verify that a vaccination pustule would give immunity, nor distinguish a true vaccine pustule from spurious ones",0
