Children should have a life ‘free from chemicals and toxic ingredients’; they wanted to provide their children with a life without such toxicity.,6

"Specialisation and vaccination expertise itself created systemic biases that were embedded in vaccination statistics to favour consistently evidence supporting vaccination; This system separated vaccinators from any failures (i.e. when those they vaccinated did catch smallpox), and it made it significantly easier for those attending smallpox cases to dismiss the skill and adequacy of the vaccinators when cataloguing cases of smallpox among the vaccinated.",1
An alternative interpretive framework for the existing epidemiology and vaccine statistics,9
"Physicians, even those specialising in vaccination, could not accurately distinguish clinically between a variety of viruses artificially inoculated in a subject (different species such as syphilis, smallpox, and other animal contagions produced clinically ambiguous signs), and thus they could neither verify that a vaccination pustule would give immunity, nor distinguish a true vaccine pustule from spurious ones",1
